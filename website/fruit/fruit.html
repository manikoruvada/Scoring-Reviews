The serving size listed for each fruit in our glossary counts as one serving in Canada's Food Guide. The number of servings you need each day depends on your age
 and gender. For example, women between the ages of 19 and 50 need seven to eight servings of fruit and vegetables each day (three fruit and four vegetable servings
 would suffice). To determine the correct number of vegetable and fruit servings for you, visit the Health Canada website (www.hc-sc.gc.ca) at and search for 
"food guide."

<p id="name"><img src="frozen.jpg">Frozen fruit</p>
If your favourite fresh fruit is only available for six weeks of the year, head to the frozen food aisle. Grocery store freezers house a variety of affordable
 frozen fruit, ranging from cubed mango to woodland blueberries to tropical fruit salad.

Not only is frozen fruit convenient, but it's also equally nutritious  if not more so  than its fresh counterpart. Fresh fruit starts to lose nutrients as 
soon as it's picked. The time between harvest and consumption can be long enough for significant nutrient losses to occur. Frozen fruit, however, is picked
 and frozen immediately, retaining much of the nutrient value. Plus, since frozen fruit is already washed, peeled and cut, it's a breeze to use. It can be 
thawed at room temperature or defrosted in the microwave. Once defrosted, eat it as you would fresh fruit, or use it atop cereal, mixed in yogurt or blended
 into smoothies.
