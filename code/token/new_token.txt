could not find this anywhere except best buygreat value
great price bought for my daughter in college and she loves it
i love the video games this series is based of off
all 5 movies in one collection for a cheap price you cant go wrong with that
didnt know there was a bluray box set and when i saw it i had to have it
i played the original game which is what got me to watch the first movie i have watched each one since all of them on their own have been above average movies and i have seen each of them at least 5 times i got the collection to watch them all together better deal to get them together than purchase separate
this is one of the best science fiction series out there
good movie collection i like the best buy special editions boxed sets and exclusive covers i usually purchase steelbook editions from best buy
always liked watching her kick butt great deal for me finding the box set i would recommend them
i came late to the re franchise so i had seen parts and pieces of all 5 but not in any order and certainly not sequentially finally i get to see the sequence as it was meant to be in order not much to say about the physical discs themselves they work but ive really enjoyed the collection
you get the first five movie on bluray though online in the description it said it came with all the digital downloads as well it didnt
this is one of my all time favorite movie franchise cant wait for the next one
what more can i say certainly not the based directed or made seriesand the forced 3d is definitely not something redeeming about the series yet fun and actionable at all times
great box set featuring an a kicking zombie goddess
i always enjoyed the games even though the movie has nothing to do with them
was happy to find that they carried the entire series excellent picture and sound if youre a fan get it
i love the resident evil series and to be able to have all the movies is awesome
this set has it all great picture and sound for a great price
if u like the resident evil series and want to see the final one next year then u need this box set it will get u ready for the final chapater next year
we enjoyed the whole series and this is a bonus to have them all packaged together in a set
loved the movies so i had to get these on bluray you will also enjoy all the bonus features dont pass this upget it
this collection is a great deal if you enjoy the franchise
great collection of all of the resident evil movies
best movies ive seen in awhile even if they are older now
if you like zombies or lots of fun action this movie collection is one on the need to own type i saw all in theaters and enjoyed them
they are the only place i could find this set and they always have the best prices upgraded to bluray and could not be happier with the product
perfect gift for someone who loves the video games
i had played the original re but never cared to watch the movies after one day seeing part of the fifth one and after having bought the re release of the remastered re i decided to give the movies a shot they pretty much met my expectations of a video game movie in terms of quality but i did enjoy watching them i would say the first one is the best and i didnt much care for the series turning into full global zombie apocalypse in the third one but i did enjoy them
even though another one is coming still being able to get all 5 movies for 30 is a awesome deal they will prob make another collection with prob all 6 but at least you can wait till the new one goes down in price
this packed film content is awesome
ive always loved the resident evil movies and to find this bundle for such a low price i am happy
all the movies in one box set is great love this series
these saved me a lot of money buying them individually love the collectors pack

the resident evil movies are the most decent video game movies ever made this collection is a great deal for all five current movies on bluray and digital
great movie resident evil collection i love the video games
if you like a lot of action zombie premise government is the bad guy and superhuman heroine then you should get a kick out of this series of movies like a lot of these kinds of movies its not to be taken too seriously but to be enjoyed for what it is an endofdays movie that the government with the best of intentions caused but they also inadvertently created the solution

this is the way to purchase these movies came with digital also

ive been looking for this product for a long time and im very pleased with it
all five movies great for fans of resident evil
bought this pack for 15 includes the first 5 movies great deal better prize than amazon
5 films for the price of one 3d bluray film it is a steal i only paid 2999 at the time and it was something i was not about to pass up considering i enjoyed the re films people who are not hardcore re fans may not enjoy these films as much because knowing the games allows the viewer to pick out little nostalgic pieces they threw into the films that were shown in the video games the quality of the blurays are outstanding though if you enjoyed the films or are simply a diehard re fan get this at this price no matter what you wont be disappointed
this is a pretty solid collection for the price the films are strange hovering somewhere between bmovie and aaa production but somehow entertaining each disc has decent amount of special features and the bluray picture and sound quality are top notch
couldnt pass this up at 1499 the films are always fun
loved the resident evils was a great deal 4 15 dollars on blu ray
5 dics for 15 cant beat that even if i dont like some of them
im a huge movie collector and when i find steals like this i act quick the re movie set actually sold out more than once during the price break and they finally got it back in stock couldnt be happier with my purchase btw its all 5 movies in separate cases which i wasnt expecting but love
a great collection of films for a low price worth it
great collection at an awesome pricea must have for your collection
this was a great purchase from a great business 2 thumbs up
great collection worth every penny mila is the best
if you are a movie buff or just like really good movies then you cant pass all these up for 15 0 o
i like these movies it was a very good value for the 1500 price for 5 blu rays
the movies may get a bit ridiculous toward the end but they are still fun to watch and i was excited to be able to get this awesome boxed set i love how shiny it is too nothing negative to say
5 great movies for a steal got a great sale plus my member points paid only 5 for entire set
this is a great deal for the set of movies on bluray and you also get all of the digital copies

exactly what you could want from a re box set if you are a fan of the films than youve already seen them this set has tons of special features all five of the original films and digital copies of each
bought all five of the first resident evil movies for 15 and it came with a free ticket to see number seven

this is a great collection at a great price and its in bluray
this was an awesome deal for the 5 disc set on bluray i was super stoked because mine included an expired vudu code that should have quit working 3 years ago but it was still good so i was able to add the entire bundle to my online library plus these movies are so great over the top action and blood and gore very well done
a great series the 5th one was a bit weak but still enjoyable
good scifizombie movie series based off the popular video game has good action and special effects
we buy movies all the time and so when we got the opportunity to get them all minus the final one we took it great sci fi collection with action all over
i started watching the original movie because i am a fan of michelle rodriguez who appears throughout the series the sequals continued to expand from the source video game stories characters delightfully blending scifi horror action suspense and even comedy overthetop action delivers in a steady build
if youre even just a casual fan of the franchise how can you not love the5 movie pack plus the digital downloads the price point was crazy cheap theres really not a single negative thing to say about it watch the movies enjoy the franchise and add it to your collection
these movies are fun and for the price i couldnt pass it up they are great quality too
is the most complete trilogy of resident evilbuyed now
well the killings continue and yes she is a looker still a must have to complete the collection of the series
i saw this bundle on vudu and it was 3x as much this was a great value for the film franchise
been a resident evil fan since the game series started picked up for 15 on sale awesome
bought these for my daughter for less than 15 and she loved it
very good series film hope they make more like the action
i got this box set at an awesome price im assuming they marked it down because there is probably a new box set coming with the release of the final re movie buy these before theyre gone it doesnt get any cheaper than this
id been looking at this box set for a while and when it went on sale for 15 i jumped on it 5 bluray movies for 15 yes please all the movies play great and each came packaged in their own case great deal
cant beat this box set for the price great movies if you like a popcorn flick with a lot of action
if you liked all the resident evil movies this collection has the first 5 on blueray for 15 a great value i bought this 5 movie collection and 6 and it was 10 cheaper than purchasing the 6 movie collection awesome
i got all 5 movies for 1499 this is a great deal
these may not be classic cinema but they are a lot of fun to watch 5 films bundled together at a great price is too hard to pass up
i got this set for a really great price and would recommend to anyone
i decided to write this review to help people know about the digital hd facts when i opened the box seteach bluray is packaged in its own box there was an ultraviolet code paper included it said to go to sonypictures to redeem instead i went to my vudu account and entered the code i received all five movies in hd the plastic wrap on the outside of the boxed set said you would get all 5 movies with 1 code the offer expired on12212014 but worked anyway if you dont get your digital copies i would suggest contacting sony as far as reviewing the movies what can i say fantastic
i was always looking to get the collection and this was an amazing deal so happy with it plus all in blue ray perfect
resident evil collection all in one enough said you dont find any better deal
if you like zombie movies you must watch this awesome collection
if youre looking to buy this collection you already know that you like the films its well worth the purchase and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it
already had first few re movies love the blue ray experience and was already sold when i first saw this blue ray bundle all movies are individually packaged and have original covers from when they first came out good buy for 15 when individual they can run from 5 to 10
already own on dvd but movie looks great on blu ray
a great bundle with all the movies this was a decent movie definitely worth checking out
own all of the previous resident evil movies except the final chapter a great choice for real collectors of movies and of resident evil each movie comes in its own case as if you were to buy them individually with another case to hold them all together
love this movie collection will probably add the newest movie too
ive always loved the games the movies are just as great
im a huge fan and needed them upgraded to blurays great price
picked this up on the cheap side and although ultraviolet copy stated it had long since expired much to my delight it was still available not as big of a fan of the 4th5th films it clearly has run its course and got too caught up in being 3d i do like the set and the 1st and 3rd movies are worth what was paid for the entire set
this is a very good bonset of a great seriea many great special features as well
dope movies although i wasnt a fan of the movies so much its a typical blockbuster for people logan was a solid movie
love these movies mila is great in every movie
if youre a fan of the resident evil games then you probably already love the movies its a great complete run of the first 5 movies at a very reasonable price despite the low price for 5 blu rays they didnt cut out any of the bonus features which my wife loved
my wife and i love watching these movies together
nice collection of movies spent the weekend watching all the movies
best buy really nailed it offering this disc set its affordable and the movies speak for themselves highly recommend adding this set to your collection the blu ray quality of these movies is fantastic
got this bundle when it was on sale got all the movies in one place
good series with nonstop zombie action would highly recommend it
excellent resident evil is really good great actors to
im a huge resident evil fan either the video game or movies and this is a great collection of each movie 15
i loved the newest one but from being able to watch all from disc number 15 i can tell how the plot line goes and it makes more sense i highly recommend this if your into action it really gets you wanting to watch more
great movies glad they come out with this one as a set
if you love a great zombie type apocalypse series you will love this i have watch majority of these movies at the theater the last movie sealed it all up it was a great ending
great price for all five films great to binge watch in preparation of part six
this was a great series i already owned a couple of the blurays of the series and now i own the whole collection
ive always been a huge resident evil fan so picking up these in a bundle was a great find
i love zombie movies the resident evil series is one of the best sometimes its a little corny but that is what movies are for to be intertaining and make things that are not real into real things on the screen
purchased this when the last movie came out for twenty bucks and enjoyed it very much the films came with download codes they looked great
great collection of movies if you like resident evil if not you will prob hate it
simply love these movies so full of action and suspense
if you have not seen any of these movies this is the perfect way to do so
if u enjoy action fighting movies you will love this not to mention zombies i like that it is a collection pack because its more worth it instead of buying one movie at a time
this collection is amazing a must buy if you are a resident evil fan
awesome deal great movies i wish they wouldve done more with the 4th movie
who doesnt love resident evil and a box set that costs less than buying one movie by its self who would hesitate to buy that
love the movies some more some less but a unbeatable price even if you dont like a couple of them
love the movies and enjoy the high quality and the fact that i can download in my tablet
the resident evil series is great tons of action and a great plot lines
epic as always each film gets better and better star wars matrix and resident evil
excellent movies each one is better than the last
already 5 sequels and many more to come there is a large fanbase out there for this resident evil franchise and i am truly one of them great cinematography and excitingly intense movie
this five disc bluray set has the best of the best of any collection the action throughout all five movies is always an edge of the seat show you gotta have a large bowl of popcorn sit back relax and watch milla jovovich entertain you from beginning to end im extremely glad to have bought this from best buy to add to my collection
the 5 movie resident evil movie pack contains all the movies as well as uv code for all 5 movies
great savings in one box set love the movies and milla all connect together very well and great extra features
just what i wanted all the movies in one boxjust wish it had the last movie in 3d but o well
this series is fun to watch lots of action as well as plausible plotyou can watch the entire series of movies without getting bored and a fun thing to do on a very snowy day
big fan of the franchise and it was a lot cheaper than buying them separately
i know not everyone is a fan of the re movies but i have to say my girlfriend and i cant seem to get enough of them are they cheesy yes do they have serious plot holes sure regardelss the action is great and i cant wait for the next movie after watching each one my favorite thing about them is they just keep going they barely ever pause to elaborate on any plot points
great action movies bluray is absolutely beautiful story line is ok but i doubt youll purchase this for the story line great thing is you dont have to be a fan of the video games to enjoy but if you are a fan this is a nobrainer buy it now
i score on this product all resident evil in one package 5 bluray for lower price
well the movies are not the best but i am a big video game fans all these movie in one big box is a great deal so if you are a resident evil video game fan you got to have it for collecting purpose
very good movie we enjoyed it very much and would purchase more from best buy
awesome move great story and superb action with this price and quality its well worth it
al five of the first resident evil movies for less than 20 does not include the last movie but a great deal overall
the resident evil series is a fun shoot em up scifi series you know exactly what youll get lots of guns lots of zombies sometimes lots of mila too and a story that is fun to follow from the beginning you cant go wrong with this box set although if you wait they might release the complete series box set soon now that the series is officially over it was a sad day when i watched the last movie in theaters
and youre these movies very much wish they keep the franchise going
i love it love the packaging love all five movie hopefully ill get that next one
i enjoy these movies and when i went to the store to buy the last movie they had these in blu ray and i upgraded my movies from dvd
my fianc introduced me to the resident evil franchise and i was not disappointed i love that it takes up so much less space than the dvd set were slowly replacing all our dvds and the picture quality is worth it
if youre a resident evil fan this is the set for you all the movies for one low price
i was impressed with the picture and quality of the bluray great sound great picture
not only the bd but now have them in vudu as well im set
id been shopping around for this set for awhile and the price with it being bluray i couldnt turn it down i would highly recommend this for any comic bookvideo game nerds just looking for a box set to binge watch through
love these movies and this was a great deal
5 movies on blu ray for about 3 a piece doesnt matter if you think these movies are good or bad its worth buying especially at that price
great movies
love the movie
good price
anyone who knows milla knows how sexy she is period these movies are not groundbreaking nor oscar worthy but definitely some cool action movies for fans of the game or just action junkies in general and of course the ever so loveable zombies which you cant leave out i recommend this collection worth every penny
love all of the action horror and the plot
great
there are little on the dry side but its up to you to try them
i have bought 100 of these online or when im walking around in the store they are amazing
we buy these for our daughter and she loves them she feels like a big girl but is safe to eat these gluten free bars this review was collected as part of a promotion
thanks for making a bar gluten free that my daughter can not only eat but absolutely loves as well
finally a granola bar that is gf but still tastes like a chocolate chip granola bar
my kids love it
if you must be gluten free and are looking for a good snack bar you can toss in your purse or pocket this is it good flavor and texture and a handy sizethey are one of my favorites
i am normally in my favoerite store weekly i needed this product each of those weeks and the shelves were empty i was forced to order on line which should not have happened i am a little disapointed but will survive
not bad just does not impress
ok
works great and holds all day i wish it was easier to remove
it lasts all day has a good flavor
use this product all the time
i have tried different types of glue for protesis but this is the best one
will order it again
nothing else has worked this well all the powder only holds until i try to do somethingyou know like eat i put this on early in the morning and they stayed tight and kept food out all day long now i can go out to dinner again without carrying spare powder
prefer this to zinc free with no flavor this product is softer and holds better would recommend to users
if you use this more then once a day then this is a great deal thomas p
ive used every dental adhesive out there and this is the only one i will choose from now on it differs from all the rest like this 1 it tastes pretty good for goop in your mouth 2 it keeps teeth exactly where they belong for at least 3 days longer than any other product of this kind 3 it is a good price for what it does and a super value too 4 it lasts longer than the others probably because i dont have to use as much to do the job 5 its pink 6 it applies evenly and neatly big difference there and comes off simply when washed being the best value is a good enough reason for choosing this one only however with all its other plusses it is a nobrainer to continue buying this brand and type always i highly recommend
used to use freedent until i heard and saw that it contained zinc discovered the poligrip i use does not like the ultra fresh better than the plain
great product its the best on the market
i have partials uppers and lowers they are starting to slip a bit so i use this goo i used a very small strip in the front works great and tastes minty fresh
works well
it was for my hubby and he loved it
have no trouble holding dentures last a long time
finally someplace that shipped what i ordered i ordered this twice before from other places and got the wrong item and had to return it thank you walmart for getting it right on the first try
i love the product but this is the slowest shipping i have ever seen i am still waitting for the prodect
i liked this it
it all i use to help me keep my dentures secure
it works wonderful
wow this really keeps a good grip on my lower partial no worries about it slipping
opened box n bamboo plant had a weird smell almost like urine i decided to air it out n arrange the plants limbs n see if in a few days the odor would subside it did i havent returned it because its just too much work so its in a corner in my living n im just trying to get use to it next time i will shop in person n buy a real plant not worth the price
the tree itself is very nice not as full as i expected but i still love it completes the look of my tropical paradise the only reason i gave 4 stars is it took a very long time for me to receive it it was on backorder for almost 2 months
another nearly natural product that looks lifelike works perfectly in our living room setting this review was collected as part of a promotion this review was collected as part of a promotion
the quality of the product is outstanding this tree looks and feels natural without the care of a natural tree i highly recommend you buy it oh and the base is nice this review was collected as part of a promotion this review was collected as part of a promotion

the show is unique ill give it that but just not the scifi show for me
not bad for futuristic show has some shortcomings however good plot and shot of america are great still the characters since they where adolescents it was hard to believe that they only they would be sent to try and establish living on earth without any other older characters
another series about what can happen after the apocolapse
a decent science fiction television series worth watching
another good show from the cw i enjoy the story and the plot
the first season is a bit rocky and over the top typical teen drama but once you get past the first half it really picks up season 2 is even better but after that it goes down hill fast much wasted potential
an engaging and entertaining show well worth the buy
this series is interesting and keeps you watching until the end it was a great way to catch up with the series so we can watch season 2
i liked the first season great characters and story
this show is quite entertaining to watch good cast and action
juvenile delinquents fight for survival in a postapocalyptic world
great quality wonderful customer service good price
i like the show and this way i have something to watch in the summer
this is one of those shows were its better to watch all at once
one of the best tv shows i have ever seen in the last year
not a bad scifi series especially since its from the cw the story line is kind of dumb but there is action and so many love triangles its hard to keep everything straight i only wish it could have been on a better network like amc or hbo
i had to really power thru those first few episode but once i did i was rewarded with a great show i love that it has great representation and makes you think
overall a good series i did not see this when it was on but now have it scheduled to record
interesting sci fi show worth watching for sci fi fans
i enjoy the young cast of the show to show how their survival modes kick in on this show very well written
the 100 is a post apocalyptic scifi offering that has many elements typical of the genre we start off about 100 years after the surface of the earth was destroyed in an atomic war thirteen nations have orbital space stations and when the thirteenth is destroyed a truce is eventually called and the remaining station unite physically forming the ark what is presumed to be the last remnant of the human race the ark has a very dysfunction society were all crimes are punished by execution floated out of an airlock juvenile offenders are reviewed at age of 18 and may be spared out story opens with clarke being taken out of juvenile detention to be sent to earth to see if the planet can support life since the ark is dying many elements of the first few episodes borrow from the lord of the flies and other science fiction works the 100 find out in a matter of a few episodes that they are indeed not alone on the planet and the situation worsens on the ark when over 300 people are removed from the life support grid which is polite language for them to be killed to allow the remaining people to live the culling was voluntary but along with the political fighting that was shown and death of likable main characters revealed a very dark undertone at times in the series the dark undertone was similar to stargate universe we are left at the end of the season with the remnants of the 100 being taken to what appears to be a surviving military bunker the ending of the first season has a deja vu appearance similar to jeremiah season one overall a good scifi effort but only combines elements already seen in the genre with no new ground breaking plot or story lines so far look forward to season two blu ray picture quality is excellent
excellent show with interesting characters and fast paced story line
the 100 series is a good tv series to watch and follow
reasonable priced fast delivery service and secured packaging cant wait for season 2 to come out
great movie for people who like scifi movies bought for my son
cw seems to have a good handle on concept series this is set in the future where the future of humanity are living in a space state after a nuclear war 100 juvenile delinquents are sent back to earth to see if they can survive and repopulate the earth interesting dynamics and mysteries between the people on the station vs earth
an interesting plot and engaging characters make this show a cut above the usual cw fare its a bingeworthy trip youll be glad you took
this season is amazing nuclear power bomb that well written
both unflinchingly brutal but all to human this post apocalyptic thrill ride is well worth the the investment
this tv series is a real good show to watch from start to finish
look past that its another teen apocalypse story and it actually is pretty good and keeps you engaged in the story line
action galore grabs your attention and holds onto it
i liked this show from beginning to end lots of suspense
just was just the beginning what a fresh ifea to come to tv
this show is a of a kind the cast is new and once you start watching you cant stop
fun show to watch when the series started keeps you interested
we missed the first season im glad we were able to purchase the 1st season dvd wow it was fantastic
i found this to be a refreshingly good series good acting and storyline going to buy season 2 and hope it keeps up
great show hope this one runs for a while good story line and good actors
finally a show that can keep me interested for more than just a half hour
a group of 100 criminal teens get sent to earth from a space station it gets better with each episode the blu ray of this looks fabulous on my 50 inch plasma need to find the rest of the series on blu ray
i have liked the 100 since the beginning there is no shortage of drama and action
excellent quality bluray set
excellent price for an amazing show also comes with digital hd which it doesnt state but was a definent plus
this dvd set arrived in a timely manner and so far i am enjoying this series i look forward to watching more
disk show is very good hope it last for many seasons shipping pass is wonderfull
cw nailed it again with another great series suspensful mysterious and dramatic show kept me wanting to watch another episode as soon as i finished the episode i was on
wasnt expecting this show to be that great but i really like iti have enjoyed it from the start cant wait to see what season 2 has in store for us
not a bad way to get rid of people who will not conform to the man
everyone needs to go get this show and watch it it gets better and better as the seasons progress which usually doesnt happen with many tv shows most shows the seasons tend to get a little worse until the show is canceled but not this show
its nice to have something other than zombies destroying the world for once and i think the show will be on for a while i havent watched the cw in years but found this show to be entertaining
i have watched the first season on tv every week when the new one came on and so i had to buy the season when it came out its a really good series and its different in many ways then others
this is a great series well thought of and very original i was disappointed when i found out that they were going to cancel it they always cancel good shows and keep garbage like the bachelor on the air but the network brought it back for an even better second season and the third is coming too awesome show
i bought this as a birthday gift for my mother and was very happy with the product received
my picky adult boy likes this series so it must be good
story about populating earth again after nuclear war it is highly rated
great new show great story with mixture of space apocalyptic surrounding and survival great extras as well
great series and enjoyed catching up can wait to own them all
this show is an amazing rollercoaster of edge of your seat thrills and crazy twists and turnsyoull never see whats coming but youll enjoy every second of it
i got into this show when i ran out of things on netflix im not usually a fan of shows from the cw because they are usually kind of terrible or at least not great i liked the idea of this show though kids get sent to a future earth where it is supposed to be uninhabitable definitely worth a try
i first watched this on netflix streaming looking for something new and was hooked had to buy it
the 100 is like a fine wine its a show that only gets better with age although the first few episodes seem like typical cwfare the emotional stakes and characters continue to develop with each subsequent episode the story beings when 100 juvenile delinquents are sent down from their space station to the war torn earth to see if it is inhabitable many years after a nuclear apocalypse questions of morality survival sacrifice and cultural politics are the central themes in the first season and continue on for the rest of the show the 100 dares to ask questions that other shows are too scared to even acknowledge its worth your time for surein my opinion the bluray release is the way to watch this show with a gorgeous picture quality and an impressive audio track you will get the most bang for your buck with this release all 13 episodes from the first season are included in this set but dont worry because season two is already out to marathon after you finish that intense and shocking cliffhanger at the end of the first season
i bought this set as a christmas gift to my sister and ended up watching the whole season with her
i heard good things about this movie and i wasnt disappointed
i love this new series please keep making these for many seasons
great series on blu ray been wanting it for a while now cant wait for the second season
i couldnt wait till i could buy the entire season normally i wouldnt buy an entire season of any show but i have to say this is the only tv series i have not had any bored moments of hurry up to some action than am interested in again
i didnt know anything about this series when i purchased it i thought the writeup on the back sounded good and seemed like something i would like just finished the 6th episode last night and it keeps getting better if you like this sort of thing you should enjoy
lot of action keeps you watching to the very end of the season
i enjoyed watching the season again this program is very inventive and unique
my friend and i watched this entire show when it first aired and then purchased it and watched it all again just in time for season 2 to start we love this show this show has a little bit of romanceactionadventurefuturistic style to it if you like any combo of the aforementioned you will love this show
very nice first season i cant wait for the s3cond part
great show at a great price bestbuy still has the best deals
great show a must get for every fan out there
if your looking for a show that changes it up youll like this one
my son really enoyed it we would recommend to all that like these kind of serious
the 100 is well worth any scifi fan‚äôs time going allin on its big concept and the many crisis that face its characters both above and on the ground
i didnt know what to expect from this show i watched the first episode really enjoyed it and proceeded to read the book which i know now was a mistake and almost put me off the show but after starting episode two i ended up binging on the rest of the series its exciting and filled with a good looking and acting cast
i wasnt sure what to expect from this show when i first saw a trailer for it but season 1 was one of my favorite shows in recent memory really happy to have it on my shelf so i can marathon whenever i want
very good show i like it a lot very good thanks best buy
its a great way to catch up on the entire season couldnt take my eyes off of the dvds they did a great job and it was reasonably priced its the only place i could find it by it while you can
this show is very well done and so far beyond what i would ever expect a show from cw to be like arrow flash the 100no wonder nobody watches nbc cbs or abc
love this show full of action and the making of it was great
great price for a blu ray and overall great show
another of cws under the radar series this is a great dysotopia series that fans of the genre will certainly enjoy this is a cant miss show
this is a great show sort of like a cross between lost and a space show great characters and acting
the sentient bananas were a little weird but still
superb plot development elevated what could have been typical cw teen angst fare great sfx and worldbuilding made every new episode an improvement no surprise really given the presence of jae marchant a former dr who producer
takes a bit to get going but it is highly entertaining
i simply love it you have to watch it first episode i was hooked unto it and can not stop wanting for more
this is a better television show than i thought great dvd
great series on the cw full of twists and turns
i really love the show and hope that the next season is even better than the first
great show nice that it comes with a digital copy
its a cw show so everyone is beautiful but dont judge this show as just a bunch of pretty people there is a lot going on and you can really have some complex issues to think about
awesome show like how they took the premise of lord of the flies and made it into this showseason ended with a great twist
i dont understand the varied reviews of this show the 100 are juvenile delinquents released from their space station prison sentences to populate a radiated earth earth is most likely not habitable but down they go and when they get to earth they not only experience a planet for the first time but they also have just been released from prison so imagine 100 irresponsible criminals get dropped on an earth that hasnt seen a human in 97 years you might expect to see some strange behavior and you do the setting is pretty awesome the characters are interesting and unless the writers completely drop the ball on the story then you can expect a pretty good show also note all the bad reviews have come from people who have just seen a single episode whos expectations were probably unrealistic in the first place this is one of the better pilots i have seen
i watched the show when it aired on the cw and had to have it on dvd i really love all the characters
i will not give the shows plot awayin the top 10 best shows on tv not better than some of the shows on hbo but very very good story line and picture is a 10
i would recommend watching it its an entertaining movie to watch
great showgood acting its just a good show from the beginning
i love scifi ‚äì and this show caught my attention i would compare this show to be similar to lost which i also love and lord of the fries the characters are believable even the bad guys ‚äì the desperation and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive made that show more exciting there are times that i actually had to pause to gather my nerve before i continued watching the plot twists here and there made it more exciting i know this is a tv show and not real life i do feel sorry for the characters that they have to fend for themselves i watched the original on netflix and now i have the opportunity to get a bluray copy i did buy the dvd version of this but i believe the compression rate was set too high and there were parts that were pixelated i am hoping for the second season to go on sale and i will buy that too if a scifi show with younger characters is for you you will not be disappointed
i really enjoyed this series i watched it on netflix and seen it on sale one day and purchased and started rewatching
i was not aware this was even a show until my wife had purchased this series i had seen it in passing through the room she was watching it in but never gave it a chance until laterit is a great show about the human power struggle of survival at almost any means necessary this is a good show that does not have to base everything around drugs or violence though there is a fair bit of violence
quick delivery incredible price and great for anyone who like psychological thrillers there is action romance scifi and the theme of difficult decisions to survive there is something for everyone here
would highly recommend the first and second season of the 100
definitely a ya show but its pretty interesting plot is rather simple but not too boring thinking about getting second season when it goes on sale
i love this show great plot characters and scenery
amazing series altogether on all different levels of science fiction things
awesome series about the future must see very well done
keeps you wanting more i just keep wanting to watch the next episode or season
great price digital copy make the bluray worth it must see tv leaves you wanting more each season
great science fiction series i will definitely pick up the other seasons when they go on sale
kinda heavy on teen drama but its a fun campy show that has some pretty intense plot twists and quality television beyond what you would expect
i found this at a price that could not be passed up the fact that it was in blu ray and included digital copy clinched it for me not only did i get best buy member points but best buy sometimes have promotions running under mypoints that give up to 3000 mypoints for in store purchases i received 200 for buying the 100
i had never even seen this show when i bought it from best buy but i took a chance on it since it was at such a great price i am very happy i took that chance as its now one of my favorite tv shows currently airing the show looks and sounds amazing on bluray and i cant wait to pick up the next two seasons on bluray as well
bough it on sale here and love to finally have this set i love it
one of the better tv shows on at the moment even my mom likes it which is amazing for a show with action and scifi
great season and cast story line is amazing would watch again and again
going in i expected another runofthemill postapocalyptic teen drama well it is that to some degree but the writing so much better than the majority of whats out there you grow to love characters that you originally disliked and even become repulsed by a few of the likeable ones just as in real life a characters actions can have deadly serious repercussions but he or she may never actually see the consequences first hand main characters are constantly being muddied and bloodied physically and mentally and at the end of the day the ramifications are real and none of them are above being killed off when this realization sinks in it truly makes for some very tense moments
i binged watch both seasons in 2 days suspenseful exciting and action packed series
my daughter and i watched it and we got hooked really quick we watch shows like the originals vampire diaries walking dead under the dome defiance revolution highly recommended
this has become one of my favorite series to watch on tv the cast of people complement each to make a very enjoyable show
i loved this movie can not wait for the followup seasons to be released this is a full throttle movie
if you love science fiction show then this is for you
iim not into tv shows but this one rocks the characters are ones you can get to know as the series progresses thru you ask yourself whats next the episodic style is awesome compared to the random episodes a lot of series do i recommend this show to anyone who wants to enjoy a good story and since this is only season 1 youll b e like me at the end wanting to buy the next season to continue the adventure
i loved this series so much i have purchased every season that comes out
one of the best post apocalyptic series ive seen in a while
one of the best tv shows out there the stories are super exciting and really have you get involved great all around
a post atomic world left from the ravages of nuclear extinction a story of survivors trying to survive the world as it now is a great bing watching series
i was really pleasantly surprised how good this show is considering the books that it came from save yourself the time and skip the books and just watch the show in fact id call it a must watch if you like either the walking dead or the the road
very suspenseful and edge of your seat show i have not had much time to watch it but i like what i have seen
such an awesome show glad i found it to add to my collection
season 1 is easily the best of the 3 seasons so far in my opinion this bluray is excellent and is the first season of 100 youths exiled to a nucleur waste laden earth set in the nottodistant future
love this series getting the other two seasons no
great series with a lot of action and drama definitely worth watching
one of my favorite tv series i finally found on blu ray and at a decent price
i love scifi and this show caught my attention i would compare this show to be similar to lost which i also love and lord of the fries the characters are believable even the bad guys the desperation and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive made that show more exciting there are times that i actually had to pause to gather my nerve before i continued watching the plot twists here and there made it more exciting i know this is a tv show and not real life i do feel sorry for the characters that they have to fend for themselves i watched the original on netflix and now i have the opportunity to get a bluray copy i did buy the dvd version of this but i believe the compression rate was set too high and there were parts that were pixelated i am hoping for the second season to go on sale and i will buy that too if a scifi show with younger characters is for you you will not be disappointed
the 100 is well worth any scifi fans time going allin on its big concept and the many crisis that face its characters both above and on the ground
love this product as it is not greasy and heavy feeling the brown bottles seem to have a better scent than the white waterproof bottles for me still the best product
ive looked and looked so glad i finally found this product it is awesome
for me this is the best suntan lotion on the market
i use this product all season long keeps my skin moistured this review was collected as part of a promotion
a friend recommended austrailian gold to me 4 years ago because my other lotion was causing rashes no rashes with ag and i will never use another tan lotion product
i have used this for years but cant find the spf 4 on the shelves unless it has bronzer in it the bronzer is messy and stains this one doesnt make a mess or stain
i have been using this lotion for several years so glad i can buy it online as it is not in stores
i love this product cannot find it anywhere so i decided to go directly to the website it was delivered in a timely fashion as well im very happy
my family and i use this so much it has great coverage along with a tan and smells great every spring break we stock up but it never lasts
i have used this since i was in 8th grade and still continue to it is the best smelling lotion out there
i love this product but disappointed that i cant find it any place but on your website keep this product
i have used this tanning lotion for years it has the best smell and keeps your skin soft
this is the best product ever and is only available here
we love this lotion the best smelling lotion on the market
have been using sp4 for years wouldnt consider anything else
i am very pleased with this purchase i cannot find this in any stores so i am happy that i can purchase this online
i became a fan of australian gold years ago in florida it was not available at that time in ct so i managed to order it on line recently i notice this brand is in most discount and drug stores but 4 is not so i looked at your website and delighted to see the array of products i tan easily and 4 is just perfect for me i get some protection and a very golden tan
this is silkysmooth easily absorbed sunscreen lotion with a light and fresh fragrance my hubby loves it even more than i do and uses it more than i do
i have been buying australian gold since around 1990 i believe its been so long i cant remember when i started buying it it is the only lotion i will buy i bought another kind way back when and i broke out in a rash and my face swelled up since using australian gold this has never happened it keeps my skin moist and soft and i never feel dried out after being in the sun i am a sun worshipper so i need to have some protection i do not burn easy and find i like the 4 the best as i get a beautiful tan without burning when out with my friends they are always using my lotion also i love the smell of the lotion everyone says i smell like a pina colada i usually have on hand at least two or three and have a bottle in every beach bag this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have been buying this for over 10 years it id silky smooth and the coconut smell is fantastic i would recommend this product to everyone the best lotion on the market this review was collected as part of a promotion
i love this sunscreen so much that i use it daily for my body lotion this review was collected as part of a promotion
works great as a sunscreen i also love the scent and not greasy this review was collected as part of a promotion
in the summer we live outside once the deep tan has set in we still want sun protection that stays on and moisturizers the only solution is austrailan gold spf 4 the lotion keeps the darkest tan smooth and silky on the hottest days buy at least two for your beach days because everyone will borrow it best sun protection ever based on over 45 years in the sun this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have been using this 4 after ive built up my tan using a stronger spf and i know im getting my sun protection while smelling fabulous even when im not outside i use the lotion to smell great and i get complements this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have used the 4 lotion for years i tried 8 but it was to much block i never got a tanned i boat 5 to 6 days a week in the sunny waters of south florida i prefer lotion over spray it keeps the surrounding area cleaner with no over spray the only drawback is the stores in my area that carries australian gold only stock spray sunscreens the best product australian gold has is the moisture lock tan extender this product stops the hurt of a bad sunburn and my skin turns into a tan the next day this product is a miracle works wonders
so very happy that you had what i was looking for love this product
i have been using this for years it not only protects from the sun but leave your skin soft because it hydrates would never use anything else
this is the best and only tanning lotion that i use stumbled across it several years ago while at the beaches and havent used any other tanning lotion since gives you a fast and beautiful tan and it smells great this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have used the particular lotion for years but it is nearly impossible to find in retail stores anymore i am very happy to be able to order it directly from the company this lotion does not have the bronzer in it so it does not make a mess on your swimwear and towel
i have native american blood and this lotion gives me the richest golden dark tan i have ever had plus my skin stays hydrated this review was collected as part of a promotion
just discovered this product will use as a year round total body moisturizer non greasy goes on easy and just melts into your skin the only draw back is that it has no availability in the traditional retail distribution channels
i have been using australian gold for several years and are very happy with the results
i have been using this lotion for several years this past year i cant find it at my local stores i buy intone cruise ships whence cruise i use spf4 and reapply often i have not burned and get allowing tan
use it every year for years now as sunscreen love it
this lipstick stays on very well it is very orange though
i use to get this product from another company but now that lucky vitamin sells it i will get it from here the shipping is always quick and the price is very good
your hemp organics lipstick is perfect
i bought this for my mom this is her favorite color and brand she says it goes on well and has great staying power
it is amazing how effective this is my husband is allergic to our dog and she sleeps in our bedroom so i kept this in our room i could tell the difference when i had it on or off the air was much purer with it on and if there was some kind of odor from our dog in our room the filter would get rid of it
overall a cute tongue in cheek comedy with some decent cinematography at points but alas its like they took expendables and actually tried too hard to not make it another expendables worth a rent on the dollar list
bought this because it was on sale because i enjoy most of the cast wasnt what i had expected but not bad
its a ok movie but it was a gift for somebody so i just bought it
bought it on black friday so the price was great i like the movie as an easy to watch typical shootem up movie
i thought the movie was alright i lost interest in it not even halfway through but i did watch the whole thing it does have action but i prefer other movies over this one
this movie was ok had to shut it off half way through red one was so much better i was hesitant on watching the 2nd one and turns out i shouldnt have the only thing good about the movie was that it was funny for 7 or less watch it
after seeing red2 i wanted to see the first one because we enjoyed the second on so much was a little disappointed in the first one though as it is not as good as red 2
its an alright action movie to watch once and awhile
would not buy the sequel just way too slow and rnding was bad
exciting and funny can watch this several times terrific cast not too suspenseful
great cast action packed cant wait to see red 2
it is good movie but not good as red 2 i saw red 2 first and then want see red
good quality bluray with clear picture and sound reds is an amusing movie with a big star cast helen mirren and john malkovich are the most amusing and fun characters
i had seen reviews of film but hadnt seen red and it was humorous
a funny movie with very good actors but confusing plot twists
another comic book turns into a movie but much more grown up than superman
this movie was entertaining but not super great ok for a laugh
typical bruce willis movie lots of action with some funny one liners
a decent action movie to keep oneself entertained when not much else to do
a movie for your parents who like older actors move to action film
before i bought the bluray i watched the movie a few times
good movie and what a great price best buy has a great selection of awesome bluray at great prices
not the most impressive or exciting film but it makes for an entertaining evening
great movie bruce willis is great love the plot this movie is a must have at a good price
fun action movie with a star cast which keeps things moving at a fast pace
red is one of the few comic book adaptations that gets it right
great movie much better than the standard bluray supports both hdr and dolby visionpicture 45auido 45hdr 3 5extras 355
action movie with bruce willis has a different perspective from other action movies husband liked the die hard movies so figured this would be a good stocking stuffer for christmas
great action and actorsactresses a lot of great laughs as well
this is a fun show maybe a little mindless but who doesnt enjoy those shows now and again
red is one of those comedic action flicks that it is easy to enjoy as long as you are not expecting anything deep plotwise that said red is an extremely fun film and is certain to entertainthe hd transfer is top notch with superb contrast and audio
red is a fun entertaining movie good action good comedy usually cant go wrong when bruce willis has to shoot stuff
the movie has a great story line and established actors the love story between willis and the girl is nice but weirdgreat action explosions and acting what more can you want waiting for red 2 this year
ok so no academy awards here but just fun characters great action decent plot excitement etc what else do you want the cast sort of tells you what kind of movie this will be so without spoiling anything if you can get it at a good price pounce and add it to the collection
movie is really good nice movie to watch with your friends
for a willis action film red has the most well rounded cast to balance out his humor although i was not aware that this was a filmonly bd the movie is great and i got it for a good price
great movie with a good cast i can watch this over and over again cant wait to see the sequel
willis as willis this old guys were spies film is a lot of fun much more than i expected look for bones from trek as the cia guy only really negative mary louise parker cant act not that pretty how did she get in this movie
all star actors in an action packed feature the comedy fits well with the movie

funny for an action movie would recommend to anyone that is a bruce willis fan
fun action movie with lots of star power action and fun
i always found myself looking at this movie but something always happen just when i get into it so i decided that i needed to buy it to fully understand what is going on its a great movie for those who love action movies

saw this movie with the wife at the theater when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed it so when it was recently on special for 399 just before christmas it was a nobrainer time for another movie night with the wifeand maybe the kidsnah

i love the movie love the plot and it was well casted
great movie lots of senior actors fun plot i want to grow up and be a agent too
they had a great deal on the first one when they released the new one
this movie is such a fun action adventure loved the actors and actresses

funny movie with decent action love the marvin character john malkovich

i love this movie stellar cast that jells together very well onscreen if you enjoy action movies with a ton of humor tied in you will love this movie there are so many subtle one liners that you will find yourself asking did i just hear that right and then bust out laughing
must see good acting lots of action good ending and plot
a movie to watch and enjoy the action without a lot of thought needed you got what is expected from the main leads willis freeman mirren etc lately ive seen a bit of karl urban in a number of action movies and he does a good job as always fun to watch
true over the top action and humor the film surprised me
my army veterans loved this one they requested to watch it at least 2 times in 1 week
funny and full of great action wonderful cast and plot
its a great story line retired cia members who the cia tries to kill but cant the funny lines that come out between the actors is a classic a good movie to laugh hour butt off
happy with the samsung smart tv for the price easy functionality
great movie with tons of laughs would recommend it for all ages
initially i resisted seeing this movie but i turned it on and was surprised would recommend strong start although a little cartoonish towards the end stillworthwhile
the mixture of the cast and there missions makes for a story that led to whats next for the characters i have both movies
interesting movie about ex cia operatives good acting by bruce willis
lots of dead bad guys kind of hokey probably was designed to be taken tongue in cheek helps us old people think we can still complete
a funny fun action movie one of bruce willis best
all the stars you want all the action you need and the laughs to seal the deal
a fun spy type movie that doesnt take itself too seriously
this was a good movie that was fun to watch about retired agents
not for those who want to have a deep meaning experience
i like the one liners in the movie particularly fro bruce willis i like the whole setting for the movie
lots of action in this movie great stars and fun to watch
i really enjoy this show its not a thinker sit back enjoy a bowl of popcorn and let it roll and dont think about it too much
i really liked it a lot it was money well spent
loved this movie and the cast is great seeing these folks work together in what i thought was a well though out plot was great
the movie is good funny and action packed movie my husband really likes the movie
i wanted to add this movie to my collection and the price was right
it is funny great cast with oneliners in the script
fun story about retired spies returning to business might work for family movie night if you dont mind blazing guns bloodless though
heyitd a dvdlol only can write so much about the quality which was fine
this is a fun action movie with alot of familiar faces giving good performances the special features are solid and the dvd is a great value for the price
a good movie to kick back relax and enjoy the second one is better then this one if you havent seen it yet
i found the movie to be very enjoyable it has a great cast of veterans actors
i had seen red2 before seeing the original red film and enjoyed it a lot this one was equally good even though parts required a stretch to be conceivably real you suspect they all had a blast making the film
this is an action filled movie with an older crew and plenty of laughter in between
best bang for your buckgreat action great comedywhat more could you ask for
its a classic action comedy big guns with some laughs thrown in
great cast this is a very well played out spy movie
this movie is fun it has the good actors in it watch it and enjoy
i liked this movie when it was released saw it on sale and added to library red 2 is just as good
this is a very funny movie there is some violence but it is done in a comical way and it is not violent like the movies of today
red has a sense of wit and whimsy as former agents are reunited against an unknown threat in their retirement
always fun to watch this film very entertaining
the cast in this movie alone was enough to warrant purchasing this the storyline was great and the dynamics between the characters was great cant wait to watch the sequel
good movie fun to watch great action movie to watch
surprisingly good action packed and quick moving
retired extremely dangerousred a funny title i thought but it was a good movie
funny dialogue and i liked all the actors in it not bad for retirees
i love this movie i had a very hard time finding a copy of this movie in stores on the day i wanted it best buy had it though from now on they will be my first stop
when i first saw this movie i didnt have any expectations whatsoever but after seeing it several times i can honestly say that this is move i love to watch just the right amount of action comedy and storyline
i like when the older stars make movies it is always very interesting
red is one of those films that gets better with each viewing the cast the story and the subject are flawless it just gets better each time you see it
intelligently written action comedy doesnt disappoint
nothing incredibly special about this other than the amazing cast but its totally fun and worth putting in for some mindless entertainment while you do other things over and over again
is a great action movie my family and i enjoy very much
just a good movie all around funny with classic actors cant go wrong with this one
great movie and the price made it better i would definitely purchase movies here again
funny movie with some old faces lots of fun and excitement
action packed wcomedic attributes big name actorsactresses
red is an action film with great performances by veteran actors explosive action scenes and plenty of humor the film doesnt take itself too seriously and for those who like action but cringe at blood and gore this is a great choice this bluray doesnt offer any special features but for a nice home viewing experience give red a try
the acting is good and there is a lot of action the characters are very engaging
this was a great action movie the only drawback to me was it sometimes got in its own way trying to add an artsy edge especially with the transitions between scenes still definitely worth watching
love the fact hollywood brought together these timeless actors for an actionpacked funny movie
an oldie but a goody big guns with some laughs thrown in
simply a fun story and a new take on the spy genera
this is a fun movie with a great cast action filled with witty comments
bruce willis and helen mirren are great loved the fastpaced action and the storyline between bruce willis and mary kay parker
it is definitely an action film and was glad that it was so cheap to buy since ive been wanting to see this for awhile
i liked this movie a lot good to see a movie featuring some of the older actors done right shows that just because youre older doesnt mean you cant do a good action movie
i had been looking for this since last year and i was happy to find it for only 800
gave this as a gift found out after getting it that the blueray edition was cheaper than dvd
an amusing farce but not really for the small children
action packed movie that will put a smile on your face
this was a solid movie featuring a lot of great actors the director did a great job of applying both humor and action to the plot and the characters carried the movie the rest of the way
great quality bluray for the price i would purchase it again
fun movie great cast glad to have on bluray now
excellent item at an unbelievable price highly recommend you should definitely buy it
fun and entertaining movie likeable characters not as good as the second but a solid foundation for the franchise
the movie have a lot of action that you will not get up from your seat
this movie is a great mix of action comedy and even a little bit of romance bruce willis is good as always helen mirren is wonderful and the rest of the cast is great as well
movie was priced right movie was priced right movie
i was very surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie it has action but also a very interesting story and characters
movies are a good way to get out of real life and escape this movie was good for that
its action comedy and bruce willis need i say more its a witty action film with great actors that are not to old to let you know that they are still out here
we watched this movie over and over it was exciting and humorous
this was pretty good when the reties come together to protect each other they they prove age is not a factor
we enjoy picking up the occasional movie on sale for times when we dont feel like watching television or our cable is out best buy offers a good selection of older movies at a great price and you can often find what you need by ordering online
this action packed spy movie has comedy as well as great action fun
an enjoyable movie with great actors definitely a good time watch
great movie glad to own on bluray it now especially good price too
good movie great actors lots of action and comedy
entertaining movie a humorous story that the actors interact well with each other making for an enjoyable experience allowing you to forget reality for a couple of hours
reds is a great movie basically old farts that r still skilled at their old cia jobs it was on sale on bluray so i snatched it up
i wasnt too sure about this one since everyone was older and this was an action movie but it was done with really good humor and still had plenty of action and entertainment surprised me in a good way good movie
this movie is so far fetched but it really cracks me up
i love the tongue in cheek dead pan humor of this movie i assume it is the same in the graphic novel but i have never read it
picked this up in the blu ray bargain bin great deal on a movie i can watch over and over
this movie is an older but good flic exceptional value for a bluray
this actioncomedy has an allstar cast that works well together
this is one fun stylish action movie if you liked oceans eleven and the man from uncle you get the idea two actors steal the show john malkovich with his insanity and helen mirren with her machine guns the only drawback not from the movie is that the discs audio is not lossless
great vehicle to feature these great stars in a fun action packed film
fun spy humor for adults a few clever twists for your afternoon entertainment
helen mirren is an absolute bamf in this film its silly and fun
the action scenes in this movie are packed with some humors this is a movie worth to watch and own
an entertaining action comedy with a wealth of good actors
good movie especially for fans of spy thrillers and ciatype flicks bruce willis is good here and so is the rest of the allstar cast definitely will watch this over and over
makes you laughs mary louis parker is so weird and funny i love the cast

great overlooked movie and excellent rransfer to 4k
very good movie to watch on 4k and has dolby vision also
red is a great action film with an awesome cast the 4k transfer was very good and a significant upgrade from the blu ray disc

you can tell all the actors had a great time making this good action a lot of laughs and great chemistry between all the leads

hilarious i recommend it to everyone the cast is outstanding they work so well together
really enjoyed the actors in this had great characters to play starts a little slow but once the first team comes to take out bruce willis character the action just go go goes loved john malkovich helen mirren and morgan freeman the cast just really worked together well and made a great team
just a bunch of older actors playing the part of older spies put out to pasture but these older guys find themselves being bumped off one by one their retaliation is a hoot to watch its exciting funny and makes you wonder why more movies arent this entertaining
watched five times so for dont miss it one of the best this year
our family loves all the stars in this movieit did not disappoint the film had serious parts humor and above all plenty of actionits nice to see movies being released that dont depend on special effects to try to entertain
this movie is just great a lot of action first half better than second half
just seen the movie red it is the best movie i have seen so far i love that morgan freeman and bruce willis have teamed up again for another great movie love the action and the post cards with the greetings from i love john malkovich as marvin and the pig that he brought with him all around great action movie
its the perfect movie funny exciting and a good plot yes it has a real plot not just a bunch of special effects actors are great its a movie to rewatch every once and a while
loved the movie so much had to buy it great actioncomedy
one of the best all around light hearted action movies of all time perfect for someone who wants actions but not all the gore that goes with most my mom loves this movie in fact this copy was for her for mothers day need i say more love this movie its always on the list for when company comes over or we just want something fun exciting to watch
good action movie to add to a collection loved the characters
red is a great movie its entertaining without using nudity or lots of gutter language
this is one of the best films where you can get all of some great old acting talent and put it to great use this movie came out perfect it must have with a second one coming out soon and it also is highly anticipatted
this is a great movie with lots of action lots of big time actors
a creative movie with classic characters bought for an excellent price
love the way that theyve taken some of our aging stars and turned them into a bunch of bad es cant wait to see red 2
i love this movie and had to have it on bluray great plot and awesome action
pure entertainment showing dont ever sneer about experience the old people in this one shows how clever some of the older generation can be just pure entertainment
i love this movie to me it is one of the better bruce willis movies
exciting kickbutt action moviedie hard meets cocoon
great movie fast moving always interesting lots of action but actually has a plot great seeing actors that we know in great rolls
i think this movie has great potential to become a classic it might not surpass other comic book movies but it definitely pulls its own weight
could not find this movie anywhere after seeing it on hbo thanks to best buys
i havent felt as good watching a movie since 2003s pirates of the caribbean unexpected lines and juxtapositions lift this tale okay so the story is very improbablenot to worry given that part of the movie experience is suspending our disbeliefbruce willis charms john malkovich is humorously irascible morgan freeman gives us his usual likable best helen mirren wields an assortment of guns and marylouise parker shows us how facial expressions and muffled sounds can turn a story line and spice up a storytheres not a single member of williss reunited team i wouldnt like to be around there they are seeking first why bruce willis is in the crosshairs then why seemingly random people are getting murdered and finally bringing the evildoers to a just end
the movie was very enjoyable and ive recommended to others
it was worth it see helen miren as an assassinneed i say more but i will the move is a roller coaster ride form city to city and on top of action theres cheeky humor
i suspect these great actors had as much fun making this film as i had watching it not a classic in the traditional sense
the only way to make this movie better is to buy it on blu ray great writing no slow or dull spots beautifully filmed action sequences and the cast are just great together
good movie with humor and action to keep me entertained throughout
a fun overthetop movie with lots of action and laughs
havent seen it but heard that its an amazing action movie giving as a present
i really enjoyed this action movie has a lot of older fantastic actors in it
i loved watching this movie plenty of twist and turns to keep you watching the out come all the actors did well im glad they made a part 2 for the movie i hope they continue making more parts for this movie
i love all bruce willis movies this one is no exception him and morgan freeman were great together looking forward to red 2 you will enjoy this movie
bruce willis and john malkovich are great in this movie it is full of action but has great one liners through out the film
loved the movie my husbands favorite series of movies
one of the better spy movies out there i bought it because my wife wanted to see red 2 and i felt it would be better to see the first movie first its one of the few movies i own that ive watched more than twice
excellent movie with alot of action the plot is believable where the actors make you laugh out loud
fantastic spy film about the cia trying unsuccessfully to retire some of their retired operatives great action and humor by entire cast
i orderd on line and picked it up at the cs desk at bb great system they were friendly at the morrow ga bb store
i orderd on line and picked it up at the cs desk at bb great system they were friendly at the morrow ga store
this movie is one of those gems mixing humor action and bits of drama it was a must have for my movie collection john malkovich was the best
bruce willis is great in this movie good movie with humor lots of action
very satisfactory very very good products very very good
i first saw this movie at the theatre and it was very entertaining watching these more mature actors in an action movie was fun
awesome movie hands down great action with a little comedy
i really enjoyed watching this film i was fast paced and never lack for action kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the show get it yourself and see very funny as well
bought it for my boyfriend he enjoyed it happy with the price and how quickly it arrived
good cast and very funny action filmworth watching again
it is a creative spin on secret agent work the actors played their parts perfectly especially john malkovich
great movie that is funny and action packed the second red movie is just as good too
great variety of actors great action humorous
the cast made this one of the most fun movies ive seen you come to expect action from bruce willis but helen mirren was soooo good
i wasnt expecting too much from this film but i was pleasantly surprised by this great little moviethe amazing cast helps drives this film along and the idea of an aging team of assassins lends itself to some great comedy moments that sit nicely alongside the action scenes
funny movie my daughter who loves pigs loves the part with open the pig
good movie very funny most of the time i like all the actors in this movie
a great movie very funny with lots of action the way the relationship between the main characters is funny and makes you want to root for them to be together
love the movie and ability to get it at a great price
the movie was great with the action and shooting people
i loved this movie everyone is wonderful in his or her part cant wait to see red 2
good movie plenty of action and intrigue interesting plot twists
i liked the movie but the first was a lot better i was not expecting a lot because it was a sequel it is worth a watch
i like the idea that getting old doesnt mean you gotta slow down just another chapter in life
great movie bruce willis does fantastic as always karl urban was a surprise hit for me in this movie doing a fantastic job much better than red 2
red is a great movie with an allstar cast all the actors portray their characters flawlessly and make this an easy watch for anyone wanting to have a good time watching a movie
this is a very good movie it does stray a little but is a joy to watch i just dont like that there are no deleted scenes or outtakes on this disk the dvd version at least has one deleted scene on it but was worth buying
bruce willis fan and always like his movies lots of action
the characters provided an explosive return to be the best
lots of action and full of humor it was very entertaining
great movie great plot great price its a great movie to own
plays very nice great picture and film recommend to everyone
great fun with these older actors john m can be menacing but here he is hilarious no oscar contender but great to watch
on of my favorite bruce willis movies i enjoyed all the action and well placed jokes
had seen this and wanted a copy of my own good comedy that really pokes fun at the various spy networks and countries
great movie much better then the sequel i definitely recommend this if you have not seen it yet
i loved this movie since i first saw it and have been looking for it for a long time at a great price and i did
this is a great movie hope the sequel lives up to this
best second movie i have seen better than the original red and i liked that movie funny flick keeps your attention and never stops with the action
what a hoot a bunch of retired extremely dangerous operatives get to make the new kids on the block look foolish take care of the bad guys at the same time
such a good movie had to buy to watch it over over
great cast good story and after watching the movie had to purchase red2 to see what happened next
i love a great comedy the cast of this movie was all top notch actors and really worked great together
we love this movie the plot is good with a lot of twists and turns that are often delivered in humorous ways yet the humor only adds to the plot and doesnt detract from the basic story line as with lots of comedy the humor is understated and not slapstick or overdone as with some comedies this is a great show
i loved the movie i thought 2 was even better than 1 not sure if they will make another one but i hope so
good movie in general shows off the capabilities of a home theater system
this movie was a great one to add to my collection the combination of willis and malkovitch is hysterical the action was just perfect and the story line was cute and was even better after they made the sequel
great story with comedy action good story great actors and even a touch of romancekinda bruce is great but everyone seems to be having so much fun that everyone is stealing the show from him it makes for some great ensemble and a movie to watch and rewatch
its good actioncomedy about retired spies or agents getting back into working to help a fellow spy whos also retired they have elite skills and give active agents a run for there moneyit has a lot of funny scenes its a movie that could be watched over and over
this is a very funny movie with great actors there is a lot of action some of it funny and over the top
it is very good dvd i think sound and resolution is good
great dc comic conver to movie if you like bruce willis you will like this john malkovich is great
i saw red 2 first and had to get this movie just because the second is awesome red 1 lives up to my expectations and more
red is a great movie hilarious plot and love all the actors

this movie isnt just a good movie it aslo has alot of great actorsmorgan freeman bruce willis ect even better i got it for less then 10
this is a great movie with a great cast and great dialogue its also one of those rare instances where the sequel is better than the first
most modern comedies are rather tepid when it comes down to it this one is absolutely hilarious it also has some of my favourite actors like karl urban and helen mirren
love this movie it had to grow on me but i think it is hilarious
from start to finish this movie will keep you entertained it has excitement humor love laughter it has it all

great movie to add to our collection great customer service
opening scene the mundane daily routine of a retired cia covert operative is exposed it was routine the show is most likely one of the best spy counter spy flicks that i have seen with a superb blend of senior casting sensitive directorship and a very wellwritten plotline of pure tablepounding actionintrigue entertainment this is the type of film you will visit again and there is a twist around every corner that is guaranteed to keep your interest up it is interesting that the plots star character frank francis is a pure romantic with a hard exterior but is soft and gooey on the inside
this movie is great you have fighting people blowing up stuff and humor my kind of film
red and red2 are awesome i loved seeing these actors it was great to see actors as they age they still have so much to offer in good movies
red is a goofball movie its saying that in the good old days or at least in the good old movie days our killers were goodtime guys
great movie very action packed and just exciting in general
i watched red 2 before the first one red is a great movie with action and humor
john malkokvich is so funny in this especially when he bats a gernade

loved this movie and found it on a fabulous sale couldnt pass it up hilarious and action packed
a good actioncomedy movie always love how morgan freeman acts

an all star cast that will make you laugh and leaving you wanting to see it again
some movies you watch once and then never again this movie you can watch over and over and always see something new to laugh at
action pack movie has some funny parts to the movie but really enjoyed it old friends coming together after a long time must watch
i had heard about this movie when it was in theaters everyone who saw it said it was great it was on sale and i purchased it and it was a very good movie and can be watched again instead of just once in a theater
a great bluray movie this is one to have in hand

i highly recommend checking out the bins at the end of the movie aisles for great deals on classic movies at reduced prices i have found some of my favorite movies here

my mom raved about this movie i wouldnt have seen it if she hadnt recommended itfun
great movie that we have loved for years bought the movie to add to our blue ray collection would recommend it for everyone
enjoyable my wife loves watching this movie fun some violence language not over done in swearing we watch it again and again
it is rare to find a movie that is packed with so many stars of the screen and is not a movie in which the stars carry a flimsy or non existent story line script this movie red has a solid script and story line and so many stars of the screen that i had to take my shoes off and use my toes to count all of them i found it amazing that none of the stars stole the screen over the others and the camera loved watching them work together a team to provide a very rich experience that sucked me into the movie
awesome movie lots of great action and funny scenes
love the red movies they are exciting and fun it was on sale and cheaper to buy than rent
great movie but it very funny
this movie is great and finding it at such a low price made our weekend perfect
we have enjoyed this action packed movie and all the actors in it
we love this movie we have purchased it several times because games and movies seem to grow feet at my house
i recommend this to anyone looking to enhance their blue ray collection
good movie great story lots of action cant go wrong
bought the first one and love it the second one is even better
found movie in clearances bin very happy i bought it
i admit when i first watched this movie i didnt expect much i think i went to see it at a dollar theater to pass some time but it turned out to be a really fun trip i found this in the bargain bin at best buy during christmas and decided to get it for a family member since i figured they like me would not have sought it out on their own
best actioncomedy ive seen for a while excellent price
great characters movie plot it has it all in fact i would recommend red 2entertaining and enjoyable all you could want for a movie night
i really enjoyed this movie which is why i bought this copy on bluray the price was very affordable
ive been wanting to see this movie for a long time i saw it on sale and realized i had some free time i had a redred2 marathon they are now two of my favorite films
this is a funny yet still a awesome movie with plenty of action cant wait to watch the 2nd one
it jas alot of adventure and great movie and would recommend to friends
one of the best movies geared toward the older audiences even my kids love it
my wife loves this movie so we had to buy it not many movies that i enjoy that she likes to watch
cool movie with a fun story attached great movie for bringing in the truly great actors
just adding to the collection was on sale for 300
this movie is funny and exciting and full of action i love that the actors are older spies they work so well with each other so that you believe that they have known each other for a long time this adds to the story and pulls you in
great movie i would reccomend it to a friend best buy always has a great selection of movies
love it everyone should watch this it is really good
as the first of 2 so far this is excellent great action keeps you wondering how its going to end enjoyed it a lot
great balance of humor and action many talented stars
john malkovich is at his weirdest best in this action packed thriller
good movie with a good cast and plenty of twists in the plot
this is just a funny movie how can anyone not recommended this
this is a really great movie it is very enjoyable the 2nd one is not as good
whats not to love with a cast like this and all that action
the movie was good and customer service was excellent
all the elements of an action film along with biting humor and sarcasm
if you retire well and stay in the swing of things you too can well if you were a 007 level operative you can keep a semblance of your youth at least for this team
this is a great action move but like the storyline as well
this movie was very funny and shows the lighter side of some great actorsactresses though some may view the plot as dubious that is not the reason for watching this film watch these great folks deliver some really funny stuff
this movie is a great comedy with a brilliant cast of characters it is great to see an action film made into a comedy
a very excellent and entertaining movie it is pure entertainment
i loved all the actors in this humor tinged thrill ride
i enjoy this action pack movie i also love the humor you can watch this movie many times
great movie great story great cast funny and action packed
ive never seen it till we got it its not bad at all
i was looking for this terrific movie at a discount and best buy came through again i watch it whenever i need a laugh
the actors flow so well together i have watched part one and two and they are both entertaining
if you liked the movie on a regular dvd its even better on bluray all of the action is right in your face
the characters are all familiar and in some cases play an unexpected roll the end is not surprising but the path taken keeps you on your toes and completely involved bruce willis is predictable and his older friends are all playing their characters extremely well i would recommend this for people from teens to old age actually purchased a second copy for a friend
i had never heard of these movies and decided to give it a try well this is a definite must see the cast is fantastic there is so much action you will never be bored make sure you see all of them
this movie is really action packed im so looking forward to the sequel
the movie is very entertaininggreat suspence and funny after all
super action and comedy in one the cast was exceptional wish morgan freedman didnt die but brave sole took one for the team

excellent movie see second movie
opening scene the mundane daily routine of a retired cia covert operative is exposed ‚äì it was routine the show is most likely one of the best spy ‚äì counter spy flicks that i have seen with a superb blend of ‚äúsenior‚äù casting sensitive directorship and a very wellwritten plotline of pure tablepounding actionintrigue entertainment this is the type of film you will visit again and there is a twist around every corner that is guaranteed to keep your interest up it is interesting that the plots star character frank francis is a pure romantic with a hard exterior but is soft and gooey on the inside
fan of bruce willis movies‚ä¶a friend recommended this one to watch plenty of action and comedy‚ä¶worth watching over again
red is great popcorn fun that i think you will enjoy the movie stars bruce willis morgan freeman marylouise parker karl urban and very funny john malkovich the movie is directed by robert schwentke who previously directed the time travelers wife and flightplan the plot of the movie frank bruce willis is retired bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house the only joy in franks life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker sarah marylouis parker sarah is as bored and lonely as frank and marks her conversations with the unknown frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life when something in franks past forces frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting sarah in the middle of the intrigue frank and sarah begin a journey into franks past and the people he used to work with like frank they are all red retired extremely dangerous i enjoyed this movie and i think you will too thank you for reading my review
this movie was absolutely great i usually not big into action but my dad is and we both loved it so much that i bought it for us right after we rented it
good movie and bruce willis was a success again
a fun movie it will hold your intrest
this is a great movie that will keep you very well entertained bruce willis is great along with his supporting cast
my husband and i just love this movie
action packed must see
funny funny
good movie funny very good actors
does not disappoint
price was great
inconvenient to go to the back of the store to photo department instead of customer service wont do it again
i love this movie it is funny very action packed and the actorsactresses are great well put together a lot of awesomeness in this one movie i watch it all the time just because its that good love love love
this is a great movie i love this movie and when you buy from walmart it is also available on vudu
i could drink this with a straw nasty full of water what happened to your good chili
i was completely disappointed in this item i opened the can and there was a smell emanating from it that made me sick since it was just 200 i threw it away i will never purchase this chili again i know it may have been a bad can but that smell was like dead flesh ugh
i can not eat anything with monosodium glutamate in it i would love to eat your chili but until it is msg free i can not
i used to buy hormel chili all the time because it did not have pork in it now i will not be buying it i was very surprised to see this why did you have to add pork
bland and want buy again
this recipe for your chill is horrible you need to revert back to the recipe you used twenty years ago then it taste great i will not be buying your chill until a new and improved recipe comes out and it better be good
i had to throw out all my hormel chili some of us dont eat pork for reasons other than health and this was always in our food stock very sad that they changed and did not tell anyone now we know
purchased this chili for years it was the best would buy by the case and eat once or twice a week about a year or so ago something changed now i have a lot of cans that i will not eat and really would not even give away its that bad it sits on the shell and finally i have resolved to just toss it out
same as wolf brand that is why we quit wolf brand and now they are the same watery no meat and yuk we will never buy again we will just make our own
i have been buying hormel chili all my life the can i opened tonight was the worst it made the whole hotdog taste bad it was runny no meat so runny it made the bun soggy i hope hormel fixes this problem id hate to change brands
use to be years ago this is the only kind of chili my grandparents had in our house but i will not be buying it anymore since i now know that it has pork in it i do not eat pork so surely do not want it in my chili
i usually buy the turkey no bean chili so had not had this for years well i accidently grab this product and i could not believe how runny and lack of meat was in this chili it had the consistency of soup which was pretty pitiful since i was having chili dogs very sad
hormel added pork to their no beans chili since i cannot eat pork i can no longer enjoy my previously favored brand on top of it there were no warning on the label indicating that they had a major recipe change and i can no longer trust this brand i would love to be able to eat their product previously it had been my goto and always in my pantry
used to buy this often either the chili has changed or my taste buds have would not buy again
runny
this tastes like canned hot dog sauce more than chili it might be okay on a hot dog with onions but not for a bowl of chili i wont buy it again
did not care for the taste and too greasy
i like hormel chili but walmart has problems with canned goods buy it at the store big time dents
good product way too expensive
the recipe in the cans has changed over the years i enjoyed the older versions they had a better chili favor the last few years i had to add more chili powder
since when does hormel put pork in their hormel chili i cant eat pork so now i cant enjoy my hormel chili cheese dip
the chili is great on a hotdog but it doesnt taste real good alone
i like it
great for chilly dogs
ok for chili in a can
the chilie was good on the hot dogs and cheese i really like the one with beans
works in a pinch with hotdogs
good on chili dogs
its ok
great for texas hots the only one ive found that has real meat in it
love this stuff but you gotta have beans
we have used hormel chili no beans for a very long time we use it on our hot dogs
good price and product
we love this at our house we use it as one ingredient to make a quick mexican dip to snack on or for parties add over a block of cream cheese and top with your favorite cheese and jalepenos as you likebake or microwave and serve
hormel chili is a great chili for those looking for a meatier home made chili taste its thicker that texas petes and avoids the blandness of pattersons this chili is close to mamas so when youre looking for a chili deserving of a hot dog look no further than hormel
love hot chili with cheese
been using about 25 years good for so many dishes
i love to use this to make chili dogs and chili cheese fries i tried other fancier brands but i always go back to this
meal in a can very good i will buy more
i use this to make a dip mix 8 oz cream cheese with chili heat and serve with tortilla chips
item has a reasonable price if a lot of item is age note that it causes severe acne
i havent used this yet but have had hormel products before and been happy
i bought this thinking that no beans meant low carbs but i was wrong 19g carbs per serving 2 per can good flavor slight chili buzz the texture is a bit pasty but is great for putting on hot dogs or in tacos
we use this on hot dogs with shredded cheese yummy
i look for brands i like but cant always get them as quantities are too large this isnt as spiced as i like but wolfe brand is all sauce and little meat now
always liked this chili
this is great if you add it to velveta or cheese sauce
i use this chili on my beef enchlidas so good
cant really mess up canned chili cheese tatter tots
exactly what i was expecting
love this chili great as chili and also as dip mixed with velveeta cheese or cream cheese dip with crackers or corn chips great for the holidays
easy and always good
i love this chili on hot dogsor a chili dog
always good on hotdogs but better in dip
always use this to make haystacks
this is usually a good product
plenty of flavor and was a great topping for the hotdogs
i use this hormel chili no beans for chili and cheese tater tots my daughter is not a bean fan so this works great
used for chili dogs

i have tried a majority of your chilli products awesome
i always buy this product because i do not like chili with beans as i have aged beans dont like me but ive never been able to understand why it cost more to remove beans from a can of chili than to add beans
good quality and taste
i used it in my dip and it was delicious i use the bean kind too both are amazing
tastes good but it is canned chili so dont expect gourmet i use it on hotdogs as well as dips for chips but to eat it like a bowl of chili no way
great on hot dogs
works great for chili dogs
always buy this brand
good item use it to make chili dogs
great for frito chili pie
great taste and exactly what i expected in taste and texture
great for making dips
thank you for adding pork now i can enjoy my hot dog sandwich
i brought chili with beans about 3 weeks ago i enjoy jow it taste
i love using this chili with rice and butter in a casserole the flavors are amazing and my kids love it
taste and texture are perfect for a chili dog
i add a can of this plus one can of stewed or other flavor tomatoes plus one can of red kidney beans and a pound of cooked drained ground beef my family members have always thought i had a secret chili recipe happening it freezes in servings for the chili dogs at midnite with a topping of cheese for years it has worked for me
i always use the hormel chili hot no beans for my chili dip a very simple recipe and everyone loves it mix 2 cans of the 15oz chili with 1 lb shredded jalapeno jack cheese i cook it in a slow cookercrock pot stirring occasionally until the cheese is melted serve with tortilla chips scoops work best hope you enjoy them
good tasting a great value
apparently the wal mart store i frequent never has hormel turkey chili wth no beans which i prefer so i buy hormel chili no beans instead its been several months since ive seen it on the shelf and who ever orders replenishment for the store must not like it cause i never see it along with frozen vegetables like coliflower ive asked several times over the last year for those two items and i get a well try harder next time the shelf label is there just not the correct product everything i buy at walmart is good and fresh when available especially the produce like fresh coliflower which i cut up an freeze before using as needed i like shopping at walmart and usually find everything i need when i dont i improvise or substitute
lol never been asked to review a canned good its a can of chili people the cylinder shape of the package was phenomenal loved the sound of popping the top its a consistent reliable product my son loves with fritos rofl
this is the only chili product i consume i would never buy another brand it tastes great and doesnt have odd additives i dont like

for years weve been making ugly dip cuz its just not that pretty to look at with a can of hormel chili no beans and one brick of cream cheese microwave for about a minute stir and continue until all the cheese is blended fabulous with corntortilla chips and people rave about it thinking it was much more difficult to make than it really is it never lasts long
i buy this chili regularly and my daughter loves it when when i heat it up in a large bowl cover it with shredded cheddar cheese and heat it again to melt the cheese then she uses tostitos scoops to scoop and eat it she is older and out of the house now but when she comes home she always looks forward to her chili bowl

i have tried other no bean brands of chili and they almost always have beens this is the only one i have found that actually has no beans and it tastes great too which is the important part right
its delicious on a hotdog
hormel chili with no beans has been my families favorite for years i remember my mother using it to make me chili dogs and now i use it for my kids and im happy to say they love it i have tried other brands but we can always taste the difference even the kids will notice the lack of meat and flavor in the other brands hormel always wins in my house

only canned chili i will buy great flavor and less fat than some other brands
some of the best chili we have bought we also love the turkey chili excellent flavor and texture
would not make hot dogs without it

hotdogs and chili is a weakness for me i just dont feel right when i go without for too long and its always hormel no beans when i do ive recently started chopping up the hot dogs and making my own sortof burrito its very tasty i dont know why i never thought of it before
has good flavor for chli dogs and frito pie
this is a great product i use it in making tamale pie love it
nothing to say here
this meal was extremely sweet and had a very strong pepper flavor i could not eat it
chicken was white meat breaded about 3 pieces lots of bell pepper sauce was thick on the rice and contents and totally overwhelmed it did not care for the taste of the sauce
this had really bad flavor was not a good product
chicken quality was poor taste was not good overall not worth the money
loaded with salt and carbs grammy
for my personal preference i wont buy this again the rice was sticking together and only a few morsels of chicken
it had good taste quality however near the bottom the rice was gummy and it wasnt mixed proportionately
my mother in law specifically asks for these little meals so she can heat up lunch with no assistance
i get this whenever want something easy as frozen goes is good
i love this and every tai pei frozen asian takeout box meals ive tried why are you consistently out of stock on nearly all of them as a primary shopper and shareholder of walmart im not very happy about the lack of stock of this item and numerous other brands of products at my store
i stumbled upon this product a week or so ago and bought it because i had never heard of it before it absolutely exceeded all of my expectations it is restaurant quality has simple and easy preparation and has ideal portion sizes
i love tai pei dinners
good flavor easy to prepare quick try it for those days you cant face the stove
the sweat and sour chicken with the rice make an each dinner
i would recommend these meals to my friends and family we have not had any bad meals by this company
my daughter loves this
fresh tasting kids love this
great taste
i discovered this item about a year ago easy to prepare and taste great
good stuff cant beat the price
this is an outstanding product it not only cleans surfaces but it has such a clean and fresh smelli use it all the time
i have been an avid user of clorox wipes for many years and loved them something has been changed about them recently and my last 3 purchases have all exhibited this change the smell it is awful they all smell the same i dont know if people on the west coast are familiar with stink bugs but here on the east coast there is an infestation thats exactly how the clorox wipes smell now please change back to the old formula quick
i have used clorox wipes for years cannot live without them or prefer not to now the smell is so irritating i will have to purchase another brand to continue my spring cleaning ive never had such a strong objection to the smell of any cleaning product please at least offer a choice in the old vs new formula
i use clorox wipes fanatically all over my home and i have done so for years i have always loved themuntil now i just got the wipes with grease fighting power and it smells horrible the main reason i use these wipes is because they make stuff smell fresh and clean i am sad to say i may be looking for a new product maybe clorox can offer 2 different kinds i dont really have grease in my bathroom or on my main kitchen counter spaces usually grease is only on my stove
being a mom of three disinfecting the home has always been a big priority to keep my family healthy and germs at a minimum i always turn to clorox to make that happen i have been using these products for many years and will continue to do so thanks for all of the great products that you offer this review was collected as part of a promotion
love clorox wipes but this batch is horrible the wipes have separated and wont come out of canister in one piece they rip and tear apart which then makes using 1 wipe useless you have to get several out just to clean something the smell is great tho
i normally buy clorox brand disinfecting wipes over generic wipes because i like the fresh scent i notice that youve changed the scent and strongly dislike it while ill look for lavender scent in the future i suspect it does not have wide distribution
please go back to original scentformula the other scent was wonderfulnew one literally gives me a headache so sad
i would give zero stars to the new formula clorox wipes i agree with all the other users that say the new formula smells awful it may cut grease now but i liked the old streak free formula a lot better and it smelled nice whatever is in the new formula that cuts grease also makes my hands burn ive switched to my store brand now since they work just as well as the new formula and they smell better and they dont make my hands burn when i use them and they dont leave streaks all over my bathroom counters mirrors and stove like the clorox wipes do now everyone including me used to love clorox wipes when they first came out learn a lesson clorox if it isnt broke dont try to fix it
these are the most frustrating and useless wipes on the market they rip coming out of the container if i cant get them out of the container in one piece what good is a bunch of little pieces not happy at all this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have used clorox wipes for a number of years and was excited to try the new products while i really like the new dispensing top the new scent is unpleasant and i wouldnt call it lemon i also didnt think that the quality of cleaning was as good as the old product while the new wipe is textured on one side and soft on the other i felt like i had to scrub much harder and the surface didnt get as clean i will not buy this product again
i was expecting these wipes to have a strong clorox smell but they dont they actually have a refreshing fragrance i use them regularly and feel confident that im eliminating germs from every surface on which i use them
i love clorox wipes and have used them and recommended them to all my friends since they came out that being said the change in formula that adjusted the fragrance is horrible they give me migraines every time they are used in the house and leave a horrible chemical scent instead of the old fresh clean smell please go back to the old one because i love your brand and will hate to switch
clorox wipes are a great product for disinfecting surfaces that harbor germs great for cleaning kitchen counters door handles and in general this review was collected as part of a promotion
love to use the wipes when cleaning the bathroom you gotta love boys this review was collected as part of a promotion
i dont like the smell of most strong cleaners and the earthy cleaners arent always enough the green top clorox wipes are my go to disinfectant wipes when we are sick this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have only used these once i prefer environmentally responsible cleaning choices that do not contain bleach which is drying to my skin but i like having something with bleach in the house at all times to use if someone is sick this review was collected as part of a promotion
i wouldnt trust any other brand when it comes to disinfecting this review was collected as part of a promotion
love the product a great value and i know my family is germ free will recommend to friends and family thanks clorox for being 1 this review was collected as part of a promotion
great product i use it all the time i like the lemon scent the best it really cleans my kitchen good this review was collected as part of a promotion
i like the wipes cause they are easy to use and handy to keep in all the roooms in the houw this review was collected as part of a promotion
it would really be nice if the wipe would pick up the hair and dust that accumulates in bathroom rather than just moving it around and leaving it in a pile on the surface youre working on you have lots of smart people working for you it seems that you would have already figured this out thanks ho cody wy
i love them their cheap and desinfected really well especialy if you have kids so handdy this review was collected as part of a promotion
although i like the convenience of a wipe there are a couple of things i do not like about this product the scent does not appeal to me also the dispenser is frustrating to use sometimes many wipes come out sometimes it takes several minutes to get one out
i wouldnt trust any other brand when it comes to disinfecting this review was collected as part of a promotion
love the product a great value and i know my family is germ free will recommend to friends and family thanks clorox for being 1 this review was collected as part of a promotion

these are great they do a superb job cleaning we especially use them in the kitchen and bathroom and disinfecting and the scents pleasant too not too overpowering but just enough so it doesnt smell like traditional cleaner the individual sheets arent so big theyre hard to work with but not so small you cant get a decent surface area done either my only quibble would be that the containers dont keep the wipes from drying out as well as id like they can occasionally be hard to close and hard to get the sheets to stay in the part where you pull them out not that these dry out quickly but that a more robust container might preserve these even longer this review was collected as part of a promotion
in 2009 i bought a brand new car with a brand new baby to put in it as the baby has grown into a messy boy the car has grown filthy i attempted to clean the muck off with car cleaners and just couldnt ever get all the yuck off and they always smelled bad my husband suggested clorox with the added it couldnt hurt to try it hesitant about the results and the abrasiveness on my car i started to scrub ill be honest and tell you i went through a whole container but the car has never looked better and i didnt mind going through a whole container because clorox was so much more affordable than the stinky car cleaners this review was collected as part of a promotion

i love this product and use it daily the price is reasonable and it always leaves my kitchen smelling fresh not only that but i know it is disinfecting my counters from certain bacteria i would recommend this product to almost anyone when i say almost anyone it is because on the label it says that you have to wipe down the surface with water if you plan to put food on it later which i worry about with my 13 month old daughter so read the label but other than that i love it
