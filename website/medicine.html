What are painkillers  are drugs that contain opium or are derived from and imitate opium. They are prescribed for pain relief and are only available by prescription. Opioid drugs act by changing the way a person experiences pain.<br/>
Examples of painkillers:<br/>
<ul><li>
    Opium - from the opium poppy, formerly used n medicine to soothe pain but is now often replaced by derivative alkaloids (as morphine or codeine) or man-made substitutes (opioids).</li>
 <li>   Morphine - the powerful, active ingredient of opium is used as a painkiller and sedative.</li>
   <li> Codeine - like morphine is found in opium, is weaker in action than morphine, and is used especially as a painkiller.
    <li>Hydrocodone - often combined with acetaminophen for use as a painkiller. Vicodin is an example.</li>
<li>    Oxycodone - a narcotic painkiller, for example OxyContin, Percocet, and Percodan.</li>

    Drowsiness
    Inability to concentrate
    Lack of energy
    Constriction of the pupils
    Flushing of the face and neck
    Constipation
    Nausea
    Vomiting
    Slow breathingâ€”Painkillers should not be used with alcohol, antihistamines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines. Since these substances slow breathing, their combined effects could lead to life-threatening respiratory depression.

<h3>Long-term effects of painkillers:</h3>

    Addiction<br/>
    Tolerance (more and more of the drug or a combination of drugs is needed to produce the same high or euphoric feeling)<br/>
    Withdrawal symptoms<br/>
    Overdose</br>

<h3>Addiction and wthdrawal:</h3>

<p>Using painkillers for an extended period of time can cause addiction and physical dependence, which means your body, develops a physical need of the drug. When the body does not receive the drug it will go into withdrawal. Symptoms of withdrawal can be similar to those symptoms of the flu, but more severe. Common symptoms are aching, fever, sweating, shaking, or chill. Other symptoms can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, insomnia, diarrhea, vomiting, cold flashes, and involuntary leg movements.</p></br>

Some of the most well known painkillers are listed below with the names you might find on a prescription label. Note that although painkillers have different potencies and are taken in different ways, when they are abused, all pose a risk for addiction and other serious effects.

Facts about Antibiotic Resistance

<p>    Antibiotic resistance is one of the world&#169;s most pressing public health problems.
    Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant ones may be left to grow and multiply.
    Overuse of antibiotics is a major modifiable cause of increases in drug-resistant bacteria.
    Overuse and misuse of antibiotics threatens the usefulness of these important drugs. Decreasing inappropriate antibiotic use is a key strategy to control antibiotic resistance.<br/>
    Antibiotic resistance in children and older adults are of particular concern because these age groups have the highest rates of antibiotic use.
    Antibiotic resistance can cause significant suffering for people who have common infections that once were easily treatable with antibiotics.
    When antibiotics do not work, infections often last longer, cause more severe illness, require more doctor visits or longer hospital stays, and involve more expensive and toxic medications. Some resistant infections can even cause death.</p>
