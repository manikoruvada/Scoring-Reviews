If you like adrenaline fueled craziness that is the Resident Evil Movies this is a great value. I was going to wait until the movie was made and released and get all of the movies but that will be a few years from now and $30 was a price i couldn't pass up.
Loved Resident Evil collection..them zombies is no joke
This is a great set, very happy with it and having a complete collection. :)
This is a great collection at a great price! Very happy with my purchase.
Great quality for watching a movie by using Blue-ray player
I enjoy sci fi movies. I can watch this movie over and over.
I would highly recommend this Blu ray movie set if you like theresident evil series.
This is an excellent series. Great way to spendo a rainy weekend!
Great movie bundle overall. Zombie type movies are my favorite. Every movie has a very good story to it.
could not find this anywhere except best buy......great value
Great price! Bought for my daughter in college and she loves it!
I love the video games this series is based of off.
All 5 movies in one collection for a cheap price, you can't go wrong with that
Didn't know there was a Blu-Ray box set and When I saw it, I had to have it!
I played the original game which is what got me to watch the first movie. I have watched each one since. All of them, on their own, have been above average movies and I have seen each of them at least 5 times. I got the collection to watch them all together. Better deal to get them together than purchase separate!
This is one of the best science fiction series out there.
Good movie collection. I like the Best Buy special editions, boxed sets, and exclusive covers. I usually purchase steelbook editions from Best Buy.
Always liked watching her kick butt, great deal for me finding the box set. I would recommend them.
I came late to the RE franchise so I had seen parts and pieces of all 5 but not in any order and certainly not sequentially. Finally I get to see the sequence as it was meant to be - in order. Not much to say about the physical discs themselves - they work. But I've really enjoyed the collection.
You get the first five movie on bluray, Though online in the description it said it came with all the digital downloads as well. it didn't.
This is one of my all time favorite movie franchise can't wait for the next one.
What more can I say, certainly not the based directed or made series....and the forced 3D is definitely not something redeeming about the series, yet fun and actionable at all times
Great Box Set Featuring An A@* Kicking Zombie Goddess!
I always enjoyed the games even though the movie has nothing to do with them.
Was happy to find that they carried the entire series. Excellent picture and sound. If you're a fan get it
I love the resident evil series and to be able to have all the movies is awesome.
This set has it all. Great picture and sound for a great price.
If u like the resident evil series and want to see the final one next year then u need this box set it will get u ready for the final chapater next year
We enjoyed the whole series and this is a bonus to have them all packaged together in a set
Loved the movies, so I had to get these on Blu-ray! You will also enjoy all the bonus features. Don't pass this up.....GET IT!
This collection is a great deal if you enjoy the franchise.
Great collection of all of the Resident Evil movies.
Best movies I've seen in awhile, even if they are older now.
If you like zombies or lots of fun action, this movie collection is one on the NEED TO OWN type. I saw all in theaters and enjoyed them.
They are the only place I could find this set, and they always have the best prices. Upgraded to bluray and could not be happier with the product
Perfect gift for someone who loves the video games.
I had played the original RE but never cared to watch the movies. After one day seeing part of the fifth one, and after having bought the re release of the remastered RE, I decided to give the movies a shot. They pretty much met my expectations of a video game movie in terms of quality, but I did enjoy watching them. I would say the first one is the best, and I didn't much care for the series turning into full, global zombie apocalypse in the third one, but I did enjoy them.
Even though another one is coming still being able to get all 5 movies for $30 is a awesome deal. They will prob make another collection with prob all 6 but at least you can wait till the new one goes down in price.
This packed film content is awesome
Ive always loved the resident evil movies and to find this bundle for such a low price i am happy.
All the movies in one box set is great, love this series.
These saved me a lot of money buying them individually. Love the collectors pack.
When you see all's the movie in a roll is really good
If your a fan of the games or just like zombie type movies, this collection is well worth it.
I got them for my son,I will be back to purchase more Blue ray dvd tapes for him.
This was an awesome deal can't wait til the new movie cones out
High quality, reasonably priced, and a must have for fans of Mila J. Perfect for a weekend marathon of Resident Evil.
Definitely worth getting if you want the whole set!
How cool is it to buy every single one of the resident evil movies are less than $50 I think I told you not to $30 or under right under 40 but for everything on the movies now or is that just came out with a new one but until then I have every single one of them and I paid a really good price price for the Blu-rays great picture love the movie
At $14.99 this set is a bargain, you get all 5 movies on Blu-Ray and on Digital HD. Decided to get this to watch in preparation to the final movie of the series.
great collection. Video and audio is awesome. Buy it!!
Pretty great collection and price was great buy for 5
Awesome collection for the price. Would recommend to anyone that loves zombie movies.
Great movie. The dvd quality is amazing. I love it.
Got this set on sale. Great movies all in one awesome bundle.
Total bang for your buck! This collection rocks my socks! Can't wait for #6!!
I got this on sale and love that I now own all the films. Just sad the new film coming out is not attached but hey !
I loved these movies even though they got mixed reviews. It's not for everyone, but if you are a fan then blu-ray is the way to go. I can't wait for the new movie to come out next year.
This Resident Evil movie is a great collection just wish it had digital copy.
I always wanted the collection, they are all great movies
I always like resident evil. And buy it in special. 14.99 very good deal :)
I really like the Resident Evil movies and the fact that they were at a reasonable price gotta love Best Buy.
I totally love this Blu-ray collection of Resident Evil. Wish the movie followed the story from the video game, but this is this good.
Love this series of movies , hope they make more..
This collection has all the Resident Evil Movies which is great if your a fan of zombie action movies!!! It has some of the best Zombie movies ever made.
Must have set if a fan of Resident Evil and Mila. Picked this up for very cheap at BB. Highly recommend if you like R.E.
As most know, originally Resident Evil was DVD, so when I started my collection most where DVD. My favorite movies I been replacing with blueray, and for the price couldn't pass it up.
These movies are great!! I price for the set is a really good deal for the amount of movies you get!!
We all know theses are a must have for friends or yourself great movies n awesome blu-ray quality picture is great sound good
These movies are a lot of fun. Alice, played by Mila Jovovich, is one bad*ss protagonist and the main reason for watching these action packed zombie/mutant/undead movies. There's even zombie dogs! This collection is a super deal for the $30 I paid while on sale. I'm more a fan of the Resident Evil games but these movies are still cool to watch.
It was awesome. Love Blu-ray quality. It was great buy.
Great movie... good sounds..Great addition to my collections..
Perfect for any lover of this movie franchise. No digital copy
Soon as I got home I had to binge watch the movies again and they came with the digital copies so I can watch anywhere
Amazing price for 5 movies!!!! Not the best acting, but the story is fun to follow.
If you're huge fan of Resident Evil video games and stuff, this is a great movies to watch.
I was happy to get this set of movies in one package. I am gearing up for the newest Resident Evil coming out and wanted to remind myself how fun this series is. Great price and so entertaining. I am stoked watching this set once again.
Love the Resident Evil movies!! And finally got all 5 movies in one collection on Bluray!!
Glad to find a collection of Resident Evil. Going to have a marathon this weekend
For some reason, the more you watch the movies, the better they get. Can't get enough of them.
These movies are a great price for all 5 movies. Lots of action!
Great set to own and had a good price.good to have the collection
I've been waiting for the box set with all 5 movies! It's perfect and the special features are so great! I definitely recommend this!
This is a great price for a great franchise. Definitely worth picking up.
This should be in any Resident Evil fans collection. Good value for the money!
My son enjoys this, and it was bought for him. He enjoys it.
By far my favorite series ever. Awesome action good story.
Love these movies, great bonus features and Easter eggs
Now These are good action movies really liked them.. and the video games also.. one more movie in this series then they done..
Great price on this collection. In blu Ray. Enjoyed watching
Whole collection for under 20.00, awesome deal and awesome series.
Other than matching Amazon.com this set was worth it.
You can't beat five movies for less the 20 bucks, and blu-ray
Fantastic collection of all resident evil movies together! Highly recommended!
All 5 resident evil movies in one set at a great price.
For a super low price. They all come sealed separately too.
Resident Evil is a cult classic. Great story line for a science fiction/zombie lover
So excited to finally own this franchise on Bluray and the price was just a cherry on top!!!
I bought this movie collection for a Christmas gift!!
Great blu ray box set at a good price. Quality is good. Watch the price though, black friday this was going for about $30 now it's half the cost.
i cant wait for the new resident evil movie.. this is a good present before the new one comes out next year
Awesome Series and crystal clear in Blu Ray. its nicety be able to walk into the store and find a collection like this.
Huge fan of the series and could't pass up this collection for its great price...especially being all blu-ray!
This is a great box set. The movies are good too, very good action movies.
Great movie set, descent price, great movie set descent price
Only OK, because after buying it discovered that a final chapter movie will be released soon... SO, I'll have to get it when its released. There goes all the series fitting under a single cover. :-)
It's a good buy because you get all of the movies. You don't have to buy each DVD and the box set looks cool.
The Resident Evil movies are the most decent video game movies ever made. This collection is a great deal for all five current movies on blu-ray and digital.
Great movie resident evil collection! I love the video games!
If you like a lot of action, zombie premise, government is the bad "guy", and super-human heroine, then you should get a kick out of this series of movies. Like a lot of these kinds of movies, it's not to be taken too seriously, but to be enjoyed for what it is. An end-of-days movie that the government "with the best of intentions" caused, but they also inadvertently created the solution.
Its nice to have all the Resident Evil blue-rays in one collection.
All 5 movies in this collection for a great low price
This is the way to purchase these movies. Came with digital also
I found this box set over the holidays at a great price. It's so convenient to have all the shows together.
Love this series can't wait for the new one that's coming
Keeps you on the edge of your seat and the suspense. A very thrilling movie
If you are a fan of Resident Evil you can't go wrong here. These are the same disks as sold individually, only at a StupidDeal price! Absolutely, unconditionally recommended!
Nothing better than the Resident Evil series of movies! Can't wait for the final chapter!
I've wanted these for a while then saw they were on sale
loved the package and the easy way to watch and store this collection, always been a fan, and I really enjoyed best buy specials and easy to enjoy
A must have for any Resident Evil enthusiast, With masive doses of Milla Jovovich to boot!
Great movie collection for the price. Would recommend for your collection.
Great trilogy on blu ray and the price was just right for this trilogy
The best reason to watch this collection is seeing the beautiful Milla look tough and sexy in black leather. Great movies, too.
These movies are much better on Blu ray than DVD, this is a set to get
I really enjoy the Resident Evil movies. I accept them for what they are. Extinction was probably my favorite of the bunch. This set is a great deal if you're a fan.
I know these movies don't get good reviews, because, let's be honest, as a movie based on Resident Evil, it is awful. The RE lore isn't done well in these movies. However, as standalone zombie/action movies, they are great and entertaining. I love these movies and having the set is great. Can't wait for the finale this month!
Awesome collection and cheaper to get bluray then dvd version from other stores. Can't wait to watch the next installment later in the month.
I picked up The Resident Evil collection because at $14.99 it was just too good to pass up. This boxed set contains the first 5 RE movies in high quality Blue Ray and this is easily one of the most fun action/horror franchise ever created. What's also awesome is that each movie gets exponentially better than the last one.
Very cheap for all 5 resident evils. Looks great. The fourth one is kinda cheesy. Got me ready for the new one. Plus, it's not on Netflix.
The entire series in one neat box. Worth it if your're a fan upgrading to Blueray.
Love these movies glad I found the whole set for anazong price
This has been under my opinion one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time, it gets you hook since the very first scene , tons of action to watch again and again.
I had never seen any of these movies, but a couple of my kids had. We enjoyed watching them together. The set made for an affordable and convenient Christmas present.
I could not pass on this deal. 5 blu- ray movies for $15. With the final movie coming out, it was a no brainer that i had to buy this collection
The movies have great graphics and the box set is packaged nicely to fit on the shelf with the rest of my movies.
This franchise I love very much,big fan of the games and the movies!!!!
I had great customer service I price matched this movie with frys electronics and got a good deal.
Not as good as the games but still cures boredom when needed.
An enjoyable franchise, not greatly dissimilar to the Underworld franchise. Great world building overall.
My fianc√© introduced me to the Resident Evil franchise and I was not disappointed. I love that it takes up so much less space than the DVD set. We're slowly replacing all our DVD's and the picture quality is worth it.
SAW THIS BOXED SET ,AN HAD TO HAVE IT, now i see theres a new RES. EVIL OUT END OF THE MONTH ,wonderful shes great !
Awesome collection but like every collection now there's a new one to add to it
I love the Resident evil franchise these movies are awesome.
This is a good series and it's fun and raw and great price
Great movie would recommend to a friend. Good price
for $15 this is a nice set of movies. these have been out for years but at this price I had to grab them.
I love all the Resident Evil movies. They were a well spent purchase.
Hours of action and thrill in this ver affordable collection!! Must have
I love the resident evil story line and for the price the box set is worth it
It saves you from buying all of the movies individually. The box set also looks really cool. It was a good buy.
The box is neat and for the price I couldn't refuse not buying the movies.
Another collection I bought. Great quality and great movie collection
I've always wanted the complete set of Resident Evil so this was perfect for me.
Pretty good deal for all of the movies on blu ray discs
Love the series and only had the first three so figured this was the better deal especially in blu-ray
Would highly recommend to any movie fans who likes this type of movie
I love this boxset. I will admit however, that these movies get progressively worse towards end of series but I still love them.
All I have to say is 5 count 'em 5 Blu-Rays for $15 what makes it even better the Resident Evil movies are fun and enjoyable
I had been wanting this set for a while and with the new movies in theaters I just couldn't pass it up. The price was amazing and who doesn't love these movies!
Had to buy for the price and because the movies are great.
Glad they made all of them together can't wait for the new one
If you're a long-time fan of the franchise or want to watch them for the first time, then this is collection you need! Not only does it come with the original blu-ray films, but it also comes with the digital copies of each film! Each film has its own blu-ray disc and case. The film cases are enclosed in one collectible, reflective sleeve, featuring the franchise's protagonist Alice. You can't go wrong with this set and it will definitely be a nice visual addition to your library.
I was excited to see them whole collection on blu Ray but I patiently waited for it to go on sale. Once I saw it for $15, I bought it immediately. Amazing deal for the series!
Excellent movie I recommend it to everybody that wants to watch the movie you can't beat that price
Great set that includes digital downloads as well. All you need to do is add one code and you have all five in your library.
These movies were a lot of fun to watch to get us refreshed for the new Resident Evil movie.
As the title says. I got a super great on the collection. I paid $15 for all five movies and on Blu-ray too.
Getting ready for the 6th and final RE all great movies. It came with Digital HD for all discs included in this box set.
Five blue ray disks For a very reasonable price. I would recommend this to anyone
Action, stunts, and a fame fatal that kicks butt. All this adds to a great story line.
Excellent movie! I saw this movie in theaters. Hm.
Was really impressed at the sale price I got this set for - $10 less than even Amazon's sale price ! That being said Ive always been a big fan of the series and now its great to have the whole set! (well minus the final film thats about to come out
fun sci fi zombie flicks that are beyond belief but look great on the tv
Action from start to finish Milla Jovovich is such a good heroin love all the movies
Love these movies!!!Got them for a great price!!!!
Loved the series. Great bundle for any fan of the series and interest in the upcoming release.
Can't wait to see the new one. Have been a RE fan since thief first movie came out and am looking forward to the new ones.
Best way to catch up before the final chapter is released is to get the entire saga in 1 collection for a great price.
Pretty good price for this set, with 5 movies included.
I am a huge fan of these series and when I saw the whole collection in Blu Ray, I knew that I had to get them!
Great set, worth the buy for fans of the films. A steal for 14.99!
Can't beat the price for 5 blu-ray movies in a box set $14.99.
Huge fan of the franchise, so for $14.99 to get them all on blu ray is an awesome deal.
great quality great deal would definitely recommend
Stopped into Best Buy and grabbed the resident evil Blu Ray collection. Got all 5 movies for a great price and will be able to have the perfect movie marathon for the upcoming release of Resident Evil: The final chapter.
All 5 together of one of my favorite movies Milla is beautiful in a kick butt role
Awesome movies. Excellent value at $15 can't beat it.
Exactly what we needed to catch up before heading to the theatre for the last movie. Easy order..easy pickup & not back-ordered like on Amazon
This is one of the best collection ever so far, love this movies and they are awesome. keeping the story up to date.
I really enjoyed this movie, I have the entire collection
Great Deal on the collection of all five Resident evil films
I love these movies!! they are awesome and I'm glad I own them now
I am a fan of these for how dumb they admit the story got, and the box set is fine good enough space, could be small or re-edition, but if you aren't a fan, look the other way (maybe Underworld?)
Great movie you guys should watch all of them highly recommend them
THE BEST FIVE MOVIES I EVER SEEN LOVED THEM ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LOVES ZOMBIE MOVIES.
Really great series, lots of action, good and interesting plot..
Nice boxed set of resident evil movies on blu Ray looks great I'm any movie collection
U cannot beat all of the resident evil movies for the price or the action
Great movie collection for fans f the Resident Evil series
I have never see the movies and seen that it was a great dark so snatched it up!
Enjoyed watching all the movies and did not think the price was bad either.
What a great deal all movies in a single collection.
Great picture. Very nice compact collection. I would recommend
Always been a fan of Resident Evil films and games. Glad to finally get the blu ray set. Graphics and special effects look great on the screen!
I have been a fan of the franchise since day one finally able to have the whole collection great deal
I've always been a resident evil and this set was grwat!
I love the movie series for resident evil! I love the fact you get 1-4. Plus it a perfect movie night!
Definitely will recommend this to all of my friends to watch
Love these movies and for the price i got all 5 what a bargain.
Enjoyed the DVD set. DVD's were excellent, no problems and really liked being able to see all the movies together.
Sweet collection at a bargain price. Really enjoyed it. This collection includes all five films, but it's missing the current film which is out as I write this. So it's incomplete. Still, this is a nice set at a decent price.
Got this set for $15 and couldn't be happier. Would recommend to any fan of action films.
Got five movies for the price of one. Lots of action in this set
I have seen only 2 of the Resident Evil movies in the series. Ready now to binge !!
Complete in love, my favorite movie. A++I saw the same item, for too much money in Walmart. I get in Best Buy a ultra excelent deal.
I got this blu-ray DVDs set for my son for Christmas. We both love watching all the Resident Evil movies and it's even better in blu-ray!
Great collection at a great price and included digital copy for all the films
If your a big fan of these movies like I am, this collection is a no brainer. $15 for a set that should be over $80 just can't beat the value.
This is a great package for the price. The movies are in individual cases. I thought that they were all in one case. It has a movie code for ultraviolet on newest movie. The code was expired but it did still work.
This was purchased for my husband and he enjoyed it.
This is a great collection of the Resident Evil films. I love how these movies have the perfect mixture of scary moments and great action. It has been fun watching Alice throughout these movies.
Was looking for a nice box set that had all the movies this did it.
This was a great buy for the price and its perfect anyones collection.
Bought the box set for my wife because she likes the resident evil movies
Nice collection at a great price. Big fan of the games and the movies are great as well
I got this box set as a gift for my significant other and I think we both enjoy it equally. If you are a resident evil fan, this is a must have! It has all 5 movies on blu-ray and each disc has a ton of special features. Buying these movies individually would be more expensive and you wouldn't have a sweet box to put them in!I've seen all the Resident Evil movies and in my opinion, they are fantastic. Zombie action movies might not be for everyone, but they are for me! Alice is a badass and the action sequences are really awesome. If you like horror, action, and zombies, these movies will be right up your alley.
Such a good deal for five movies. It's obviously worth it.
Great package of movies for the price! It's great!
I'm a huge fan of the game but not the movies jus got it cause the whole collection in blu ray was on $15 my kids enjoy the films
Great box set with digital copies included! Expired code but Sony accepted it.
I've been looking for this product for a long time and I'm very pleased with it
All five movies. Great for fans of resident evil!!
Bought this pack for $15, includes the first 5 movies. Great deal, better prize than amazon.
5 films for the price of one 3D blu-ray film. It is a steal. I only paid $29.99 at the time and it was something I was not about to pass up considering I enjoyed the RE films. People who are not hardcore RE fans may not enjoy these films as much because knowing the games allows the viewer to pick out little nostalgic pieces they threw into the films that were shown in the video games. The quality of the blu-rays are outstanding though. If you enjoyed the films or are simply a die-hard RE fan, get this. At this price, no matter what, you won't be disappointed.
This is a pretty solid collection for the price. The films are strange, hovering somewhere between b-movie and AAA production, but somehow entertaining. Each disc has decent amount of special features, and the bluray picture and sound quality are top notch.
Couldn't pass this up at $14.99. The films are always fun.
Loved the resident evils was a great deal 4 15 dollars on blu ray
5 dics for 15 can't beat that even if i don't like some of them.
I'm a huge movie collector and when I find STEALS like This I act quick! The RE movie set actually sold out more than once during the price break and they finally got it back in stock! Couldn't be happier with my purchase! Btw, it's all 5 movies in separate cases, which I wasn't expecting but love!
A great collection of films for a low price. Worth it.
great collection at an awesome price.a must have for your collection
This was a great purchase from a great business 2 thumbs up
Great collection! Worth every penny! Mila is the best!
If you are a movie buff or just like really good movies then you can't pass all these up for $15!!! :0 :O
I like these movies. It was a very good value for the 15.00 price for 5 blu rays.
The movies may get a bit ridiculous toward the end, but they are still fun to watch, and I was excited to be able to get this awesome boxed set. I love how shiny it is, too! Nothing negative to say.
5 great movies for a steal. Got a great sale plus my member points. Paid only $5 for entire set.
This is a great deal for the set of movies on blu-ray and you also get all of the digital copies
Lot of action,great zombie story with amazing make up!
Great deal for the set! Also includes a voucher to go see the final chapter
I was very excited when I found this box set. Perfect for binge watching, and a high quality Blu-ray.
This collection bundles all of the theatrical movies released at this point. All of the movies come in their own individual case. High recommend to anyone who is a fan of the series, or someone who is looking for an awesome series of action movies.
I have watched all of the 5 movies in this bundle many time for the price it was the best deal I have ever in all my 58 years awesome bundel
If you get the chance to get these 5 DVD's run out as fast as you can.
This set is amazing and the price is even better. You have every movie.
Great deal only 14.99 for five movies. Great special features and audio.
This is nice box set of the first 5 films and at a great price, loaded with special features and a great artwork on the covers as well as the box. If you buy this all you have to do is get the last one which is coming out soon. I recommend this series, if you like the games and you want something different but in the same world as Resident Evil then pick this set up.
Has all the resident evil movies and all the special features...what more could you ask for especially if you're a fan of the series!
Been a fan of the series since the beginning. This is a great collector's set at a great price.
Great price in this set of blurays so I picked it up. Awesome movies
One of the best movie collection. At such a great price.
The lovely Mila Jovovich in HD, what more can be said. Just simply awesome. Also 5 blockbuster movies for $15 all in one set. Can't argue with that deal.
This came with all the resident evil movies out so far!!! All so good and it came with the digital copies too!!
Love that this bundle has all the movies included. Instead of individually buying each movie, I got the bulk. Great price for the set!
had an issue with the dads went to store fixed problem .. very happy with customer service
AMAZING COLLECTION!! Movies are of course amazing.
We got this for my father in law and he loves it. The picture is great!!!
I love the Resident Evil movie series, so I picked up this collection to re-watch them all before the release of the latest and final entry. The quality was excellent across all of the movies and the price I bought it for was definitely an awesome bonus.
this is simple 5 great movies one low price, if you love the Resident evil franchise this is a must buy.
Been waiting to get this movies on blue ray the price was great I got the whole set
great movies for the price had a resident evil marathon
If you like Resident Evil, this is an awesome way to catch up on all the movies if you are planning on seeing the final chapter in the theaters.. great price too!
Got these for my daughter since she hasn't seen them, she loved them!
I watched two of the movies (DVD) in this series and when I saw that it was being sold on Blu-ray with all the movies included, I had to buy it.
I think i got a great deal for all 5 blu rey movies
Great price and of course love the movies...now I just need to see the final chapter
This series has been a fun ride all the way through. Looking forward to the new movie which will then be added to this collection. Awesome price for the collection too!
Everything was good from the in store experience to the order being delivered when promised
Happy to have all the movies on one packAnother add to my collection
Great deal on the set. Pretty good story line. Would recommend.
love all the resident evil films great action can't wait for the last film
I love Resident Evil so it was a no brainer to buy the collection especially for that price.
Finally, I can add these to the collection and know that it is complete. Great series to much popcorn from and enjoy the action.
Amazing value, was really happy to see such a deal.
Great set of films at an amazing price. Excellent bluray collection
This is a great blu ray set to own @ $15. for the 5 films.
EXCELLENT MOVIES ALL 5 INCLUDED IN RESIDENT EVIL COLLECTION. GREAT BUY. NOT FOR THE YOUNGER SET 10 OR YOUNGER.
Have loved this series since the first movie came out and really enjoyed watching them all again. Cant wait for the last movie to come out of video. By far one of my favorite zombie type movies.
Bought this as a gift. I ended up keeping it for myself
Got a great deal on this set. The movies are o.k., but with the deal, I couldn't pass the set up.
If you are a fan of Resident Evil and do not have the movies yet, this is the set for you! Not only do you have the first 5 movies, but you also get the digital copies as well for what amounts to the price of just 2 of the movies on their own! While this diverges from the video games of the same name, the movies are a fun thrill ride with plenty of action!
All 5 movies, can you say marathon! Awesome franchise, wish they would make more.
Finally somewhere that has the resident evils in one box set! Movies play great, and I think the price I paid for it was awesome!
I enjoyed the series I decided to buy the full set. Great movies
Liked the movies and was able to pick up all 5 on blu ray with digital copies for $15.
Love this franchise. 5 blurays for a great price. Get it.
Glad I purchased. All movies in one set. Could not beat the price.
Got the collection on sale! Movie is very entertaining. Great movie collection to have.
This is a good deal for people who like movie and video games
Great deal for the 5 movie blu ray st I love the series
It's perfect to get caught up to. Than you could watch the new movie.
I was so excited to see they had a box set of all Resident Evil movies. For all the movies, it was under $25.
ALL ACTION WITH GREAT PRICE. SHE IS ONE GREAT FEMALE ACTION ACTORE.
I have been looking for all the Resident Evil movies in a set for a while and when i saw this at Best Buy, I knew that I had to get it. All 5 movies and for only 14.99, was a steal.
Great picture quality and fantastic sound. They did a great job on this blu ray!!!!!!!
Great zombie series. Lots of action and zombie death. Love to see women in strong roles
Such a great deal. So nice to get all the movies and digital copies!
Love the Resident Evil movies! Great Blu Ray set for an awesome price!
This was great buy for sale price, 5 movies in the set
I love all the movies and having them all in one collection on blu ray is a wonderful thing.
i love the video games now i love the movies and all 5 for 20 dollars you cant beat that
Another movie for my collection and for the price is good.
great movies the resident evil series is a must see
This is a great collection. If you love the games, you're probably gonna like these movies, probably.
This was a great movie got it for kid and he want it watch over and over.
This movie bundle is an awesome collection for those RE fans!! Binge watch worthy!!
Great collection of movies. Digital is included for all movies
Movies were great on DVD blu ray is even better plus all in one package
An awesome deal for a great series!!! All the movies came in the pack
Best value for your buck! All 5 films in separate cases for less than $15 and digital copies were included!
It's nice getting them all in one set. Set is perfect, no flaws in DVD's.
This is a great buy! The first five resident evil films for $14.99. I'm not really a fan of the first film, but the four sequels are fun to watch. The final film will be released on blu ray soon. I suggest picking this collection up at this affordable price while it's available.
To Have All The First Five Movies For One Low price. Can't beat it
Nice addition to my growing library of Blu-Ray movies. Price was really low for a brand new movie.
For $15 I got the collection great deal, this set only came with 1 digital code for retribution.
This is an awesome collection of all the Resident Evil movies. This is the definitely the best group of movies.
5 movie collection box set for 14.99! That's an awsime price! Great item to own.
first and foremost, unlike the other reviews you might read, this does NOT come with all the digital codes. For me, that mattered. I was bummed to see it only came with a code for retribution but at this price point, you really can't argue. All five movies are included. The movies progressively get worse but it's a zombie apocalypse movie and in the end, they're just mind numbingly fun. I'd watch them over and over again.
Great Box Set- We enjoyed these old classics over again!
I picked this up for 15$ right before the final chapter came out. Perfect time to buy
I've always liked these movies, and this set got me all of them with a far cheaper price than buying them seperately.
Great buy for this 5 pack. Love this movie and it's sequels. Can't wait for the next new release.
The 5-Movie Resident Evil Collection (Resident Evil/Resident Evil:Apocalypse/Resident Evil:Extinction/Resident Evil: Retribution/Resident Evil:Afterlife)These movies are what they are and I enjoyed them very much. Look forward to every movie being more ridiculous than the next.
This set was a great buy.I was very pleased to find this for this price.
I bought this package because of the great price and that digital copy was imcluded
One of my favorites. Great quality and story line.
Great quality box set. Have all five movies in blu ray.
With being a huge fan of the video games, buying this box set was a no brainer. And at that price..... Genius
If you like the this movie series, then you defiantly should pick this up. Great way to catch up!
I am glad I saw this when I did, my daughter took all the ones I purchased separately. Now I can binge watch and be ready for when the next one comes out on blu-ray.
I can't wait for the final chapter to come out. They we're all good movies.
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's such a good movie, even though; you disagree or not.. Its worth to watch..
The Resident Evil franchise is pure guilty pleasure. It's not meant to be taken seriously at all. Just enjoy the eye candy kicking zombie butt!
If you love action and sci-fi-fi then this is for you. Must have to complete your Resident Evil collection and to know the ending to this amazing story.
These movies are great on their own and packaged together they offer many hours of entertainment.
I love the resident evil franchise movie. Its very entertaining.
awesome and would definitely recommend to a friend
This was very expensive which is great for so many movies
Five Resident Evil movies on BluRay together for a low price.
Excellent movies to add to your blu ray collection.
Got them all now! Love this franchise! Great deal at Best Buy!
Follow Alice as she discovers herself and help bring down umbrella corporation
Exactly what you could want from a RE box set. If you are a fan of the films than you've already seen them. This set has tons of special features, all five of the original films and digital copies of each.
Bought all five of the first resident evil movies for $15!! And it came with a free ticket to see number seven!
I was looking for the whole movie collection for cheap price and I did and it was well worth the price
Now you can see Alice in all of her kick-a** glory in one place. Super great value price.
Nice to have all of the movies together in one place.
I'd been checking this out at Best Buy and it didn't come with the Ultraviolet copies. I was going to wait in hope for a new box set to come out with the upcoming release of the new Resident Evil. Then I went back and lo and behold the set came with the digital copies with no price increase. What a screaming deal at $14.99 for all five movies. I highly recommend you don't miss this one!
Very nice set for the money, just have to wait for the last one to come out
Nothing like having the whole collection of resident evil! All fought up now to watch the movie in theathers
Picked this collection up for a steal of a price. Had all 5 films in individual cases.
What a price for this collection ! These movies are great
All in all this is a very entertaining series of movies that SciFi and Fantasy buffs will (should) enjoy.
Great way for fans of the series to get their hands on all of the Resident Evil movies to prep them for the latest installment. Even if you already own a couple of the titles, the price of this set to own them all in Blu-Ray format is a no brainer. Grab your favorite snacks and drinks, crank up the surround sound, and settle down on your couch for a marathon of Alice!
These movies are just so awesome. I love to watch them over and over again. So much action.
My review, this is the best video game to movie franchise. with only mortal combat coming n second. They did a great job with all 5 movies so far. cannot wait until the final chapter is delivered to my house
I have these on dvd and saw the blue rays on sale. I went ahead and upgraded
Classic movies in Blu-Ray. The price is right, especially since the new movie is released on DVD next week. Perfect time to catch up and get ready for the new release.
Great price for the five films on Blu-Ray-- discounted at under $15 bucks! Can't wait for the final film in the series coming out next week and I'll binge watch all 6 films!
FINALLY GOT THIS WHEN i WAITED FOREVER TO GET IT ON BLURAY. AND ITS WORTH IT. THE RESOLUTION UPGRADE IS GREAT!
Got the entire set for $15! Less than 3 dollars a movie!
Very happy this is a great series which I have watched many times. I is convienent to have all in one box
5 movies for 15 dollars, really good deal. Make sure each package had different movies. Seen one with double movies
Perfect for the fan of blow stuff up and turn off my brain.
I'm a fan of the Resident Evil franchise. I was at BB and saw this Blu-Ray 5 disc set on sale. Since the new "Final Chapter" was just released on DVD, it was time to add the entire series in Blu-Ray to my video library.
Super series. The franchise is great start to finish. Can not beat the price.
Go to this movie set super cheap. Hadn't seen all of them but they were all good movies! Great price!!
definitely a good deal! These came with a code for downloading them too!
I am a big fan of this series. Definately worth the money for the bluray set.
Great series last one just came out as a separate movie
Great deal. All five movies on bluy ray plus all five digitally. If you like series get it.
Excellent value, Great movie Series, excellent Action
These are fun movies for a rainy day. You can't pass up all 5 blu-rays in one package for a cheap price!
I am very happy with this bundle, the blue-ray discs come with full features and the digital download which makes this a steal.
I will watch any movie where I can see mills jovovichs body.
This is a great collection at a great price and its in blu-ray!
This was an awesome deal for the 5 disc set on blu-ray. I was super stoked because mine included an expired vudu code that should have quit working 3 years ago but it was still good so I was able to add the entire bundle to my online library. Plus these movies are so great. Over the top action and blood and gore. Very well done.
A great series. The 5th one was a bit weak but still enjoyable
Good sci-fi/zombie movie series based off the popular video game. Has good action and special effects.
We buy movies all the time and so when we got the opportunity to get them all minus the final one we took it. Great sci fi collection with action all over.
I started watching the original movie because I am a fan of Michelle Rodriguez (who appears throughout the series). The sequals continued to expand from the source video game stories & characters, delightfully blending sci-fi, horror, action, suspense and even comedy! Over-the-top action delivers in a steady build!
If you're even just a casual fan of the franchise, how can you not love the5 movie pack plus the digital downloads? The price point was crazy cheap. There's really not a single negative thing to say about it. Watch the movies, enjoy the franchise, and add it to your collection.
These movies are fun and for the price I couldn't pass it up. They are great quality too.
Is the most complete trilogy of Resident Evil.Buyed now.
Well the killings continue and yes she is a looker still. A must have to complete the collection of the series
I saw this bundle on Vudu and it was 3x as much! This was a great value for the film franchise!
Been a Resident Evil fan since the game series started. Picked up for $15 on sale! Awesome!
Bought these for my daughter for less than 15$ and she loved it.
Very good series film. Hope they make more. like the action.
I got this box set at an awesome price. I'm assuming they marked it down because there is probably a new box set coming with the release of the final RE movie. Buy these before they're gone. It doesn't get any cheaper than this.
I'd been looking at this box set for a while and when it went on sale for $15 I jumped on it. 5 bluray movies for $15? Yes please! All the movies play great and each came packaged in their own case. Great deal!
Can't beat this box set for the price! Great movies if you like a popcorn flick with a lot of action!
if you liked all the Resident Evil movies this collection has the first 5 on blue-ray for $15 a great value. I bought this 5 movie collection and #6 and it was $10 cheaper than purchasing the 6 movie collection. Awesome!
i got all 5 movies for 14.99 this is a great deal.
These may not be classic cinema but they are a lot of fun to watch. 5 films bundled together at a great price is too hard to pass up
I got this set for a really great price and would recommend to anyone!!
I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW TO HELP PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE DIGITAL HD FACTS. WHEN I OPENED THE BOX SET(EACH BLU-RAY IS PACKAGED IN IT'S OWN BOX) THERE WAS AN ULTRAVIOLET CODE PAPER INCLUDED. IT SAID TO GO TO SONYPICTURES TO REDEEM. INSTEAD I WENT TO MY VUDU ACCOUNT AND ENTERED THE CODE. I RECEIVED ALL FIVE MOVIES IN HD. THE PLASTIC WRAP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOXED SET SAID YOU WOULD GET ALL 5 MOVIES WITH 1 CODE. THE OFFER EXPIRED ON12/21/2014 BUT WORKED ANYWAY. IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR DIGITAL COPIES I WOULD SUGGEST CONTACTING SONY. AS FAR AS REVIEWING THE MOVIES WHAT CAN I SAY? FANTASTIC!!!!!
I was always looking to get the collection and this was an amazing deal, so happy with it plus all in blue ray? Perfect!
Resident Evil collection all in one... enough said! You don't find any better deal.
If you like zombie movies you must watch this awesome collection!
If you're looking to buy this collection you already know that you like the films. Its well worth the purchase and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it.
Already had first few RE movies, love the blue ray experience and was already sold when I first saw this blue ray bundle. All movies are individually packaged and have original covers from when they first came out. Good buy for 15 when individual they can run from 5 to $10.
Already own on DVD, but Movie looks great on Blu Ray
A great bundle with all the movies. This was a decent movie definitely worth checking out.
Own all of the previous Resident Evil movies except the Final Chapter. A great choice for real collectors of movies and of Resident Evil. Each movie comes in its own case as if you were to buy them individually with another case to hold them all together.
Love this movie collection. Will probably add the newest movie too.
I've always loved the games the movies are just as great!!!!
I'm a huge fan and needed them upgraded to blurays. Great price
Picked this up on the cheap side and, although Ultraviolet copy stated it had long since expired, much to my delight it was still available. Not as big of a fan of the 4th/5th films (it clearly has run it's course and got too caught up in being 3D), I do like the set and the 1st and 3rd movies are worth what was paid for the entire set.
This is a very good bonset of a great seriea. Many great special features as well
Dope movies, although I wasn't a fan of the movies so much, it's a typical blockbuster for people. Logan was a solid movie.
Love these movies!!! Mila is great in every movie!!!
If you're a fan of the resident evil game's, then you probably already love the movies. It's a great complete run of the first 5 movies at a very reasonable price. Despite the low price for 5 blu rays they didn't cut out any of the bonus features. Which my wife loved.
My wife and I love watching these movies together.
Nice collection of movies. Spent the weekend watching all the movies
Best buy really nailed it offering this disc set. It's affordable and the movies speak for themselves. Highly recommend adding this set to your collection. The blu ray quality of these movies is fantastic.
Got this bundle when it was on sale. Got all the movies in one place.
Good series with non-stop zombie action. Would highly recommend it.
Excellent, resident evil is really good. Great actors to.
I'm a huge Resident Evil fan either the video game or movies and this is a great collection of each movie 1-5.
I loved the newest one but from being able to watch all from disc number 1-5 I can tell how the plot line goes and it makes more sense. I highly recommend this if your into action it really gets you wanting to watch more.
Great movies glad they come out with this one as a set.
If you love a great Zombie type apocalypse series, you will love this. I have watch majority of these movies at the theater. The last movie sealed it all up. It was a great ending.
Great price for all five films! Great to binge watch in preparation of part six!
This was a great series. I already owned a couple of the blu-rays of the series, and now I own the whole collection.
I've always been a huge Resident Evil fan so picking up these in a bundle was a great find!
I love zombie movies. The resident evil series is one of the best. Sometimes it's a little corny but that is what movies are for to be intertaining and make things that are not real into real things on the screen.
Purchased this when the last movie came out for twenty bucks and enjoyed it very much. The films came with download codes. They looked great!
Great collection of movies if you like resident evil. If not.. you will prob hate it.
Simply love these movies! So full of action and suspense.
if you have not seen any of these movies, this is the perfect way to do so
If u enjoy action fighting movies, you will love this! Not to mention, ZOMBIES! I like that it is a collection pack because it's more worth it instead of buying one movie at a time.
This collection is amazing. A must buy if you are a resident evil fan! :)
Awesome deal great movies !!!! I wish they would've done more with the 4th movie
Who doesn't love Resident Evil? And a box set that costs less than buying one movie by it's self, who would hesitate to buy that?
love the movies, some more some less, but a unbeatable price even if you don't like a couple of them
Love the movies and enjoy the high quality, and the fact that i can download in my tablet
The Resident Evil series is great, tons of action and a great plot lines!
Epic as always! Each film gets better and better! Star Wars... Matrix... And Resident Evil
excellent movies each one is better than the last .
Already 5 sequels and many more to come. There is a large fanbase out there for this Resident Evil franchise and I am truly one of them. Great cinematography and excitingly intense movie.
This five disc Blu-Ray set has the best of the best of any collection. The action throughout all five movies is always an edge of the seat show. You gotta have a large bowl of popcorn, sit back, relax and watch Milla Jovovich entertain you from beginning to end. I'm extremely glad to have bought this from Best Buy to add to my collection.
The 5 movie Resident Evil Movie pack contains all the movies as well as UV code for all 5 movies.
Great Savings in one box set!!! Love the movies and Milla. All Connect together very well and great extra features.
Just what I wanted all the movies in one box..just wish it had the last movie in 3d but o well
This series is fun to watch. Lot's of action as well as plausible plot.You can watch the entire series of movies without getting bored, and a fun thing to do on a very snowy day.
big fan of the franchise and it was a lot cheaper than buying them separately.
I know not everyone is a fan of the RE movies, but I have to say my girlfriend and I can't seem to get enough of them. Are they cheesy? Yes. Do they have serious plot holes? Sure. Regardelss the action is great and I can't wait for the next movie after watching each one. My favorite thing about them is they just keep going, they barely ever pause to elaborate on any plot points.
Great action movies! Blu-ray is absolutely beautiful! Story line is ok, but I doubt you'll purchase this for the story line. Great thing is you don't have to be a fan of the video games to enjoy. But if you are a fan, this is a no-brainer. Buy it now!
i score on this product... all resident evil in one package ... 5 blu-ray for lower price.
Well the movies are not the best but I am a big video game fans. All these movie in one big box is a great deal! So if you are a resident evil video game fan. You got to have it for collecting purpose.
Very good movie. We enjoyed it very much and would purchase more from Best Buy.
Awesome move, great story and superb action. With this price and quality its well worth it.
Al five of the first resident evil movies for less than $20! Does not include the last movie, but a great deal overall
The Resident Evil series is a fun shoot 'em up sci-fi series. You know exactly what you'll get. Lots of guns. Lots of zombies. Sometimes lots of Mila too! And a story that is fun to follow from the beginning. You can't go wrong with this box set although if you wait, they might release the complete series box set soon now that the series is officially over. It was a sad day when I watched the last movie in theaters.
And you're these movies very much wish they keep the franchise going
I love it love the packaging love all five movie hopefully I'll get that next one
I enjoy these movies and when I went to the store to buy the last movie they had these in blu ray and I upgraded my movies from DVD
My fianc introduced me to the Resident Evil franchise and I was not disappointed. I love that it takes up so much less space than the DVD set. We're slowly replacing all our DVD's and the picture quality is worth it.
If you're a resident Evil fan, this is the set for you. All the movies for one low price.
I was impressed with the picture and quality of the bluray. Great sound. Great picture.
Not only the BD, but now have them in VuDu as well. I'm set!
I'd been shopping around for this set for awhile and the price with it being bluray I couldn't turn it down. I would highly recommend this for any comic book/video game nerds just looking for a box set to binge watch through.
Love these movies and this was a great deal.
5 movies on Blu Ray for about 3 a piece. Doesn't matter if you think these movies are Good or bad, it's worth buying especially at that price.
great movies
love the movie
Good price
Anyone who knows Milla knows how sexy she is period. These movies are not groundbreaking nor Oscar worthy but definitely some cool action movies for fans of the game or just action junkies in general and of course the ever so loveable zombies which you can't leave out. I recommend this collection worth every penny!
Love all of the action, horror and the plot.
great
There are little on the dry side but it's up to you to try them
I have bought 100 of these, online or when Im walking around in the store. They are amazing !
We buy these for our daughter and she loves them! She feels like a big girl but is safe to eat these gluten free bars. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Thanks for making a bar gluten free that my daughter can not only eat but absolutely loves as well.
Finally a granola bar that is GF but still tastes like a chocolate chip granola bar!!!
My kids love it...
If you must be gluten free and are looking for a good snack bar you can toss in your purse or pocket, this is it. Good flavor and texture and a handy size...they are one of my favorites.
I am normally in my favoerite store weekly. I needed this product each of those weeks and the shelves were empty. I was forced to order on line which should not have happened. I am a little disapointed but will survive.
not bad just does not impress
ok !
Works great and holds all day. I wish it was easier to remove.
It lasts all day. Has a good flavor.
Use this product all the time
I have tried different types of glue for protesis but this is the best one.
Will order it again
Nothing else has worked this well! All the powder only holds until I try to do something,,,you know, like EAT! I put this on early in the morning, and they stayed tight, and kept food out all day long! Now I can go out to dinner again without carrying spare powder.
Prefer this to zinc free with no flavor. this product is softer and holds better. Would recommend to users.
If you use this more then once a day then this is a great deal. Thomas P
I've used every dental adhesive out there and this is the only one I will choose from now on. It differs from all the rest like this: 1) It tastes pretty good for goop in your mouth. 2) It keeps teeth exactly where they belong for at least 3 days longer than ANY other product of this kind. 3) It is a good price for what it does and a super value too. 4) It lasts longer than the others probably because I don't have to use as much to do the job. 5) Its pink! 6) It applies evenly and neatly (BIG difference there) and comes off simply when washed. Being the BEST value is a good enough reason for choosing this one only however, with all its other plusses, it is a no-brainer to continue buying this brand and type always. I highly recommend.
Used to use Freedent until I heard and saw that it contained zinc. Discovered the poligrip I use does not. Like the Ultra Fresh better than the plain.
Great product it's the best on the market
I have partials, uppers and lowers. They are starting to slip a bit, so I use this goo. I used a very small strip in the front. Works great and tastes minty fresh.
Works well.
it was for my hubby and he loved it.
Have no trouble holding dentures last a long time.
Finally someplace that shipped what I ordered. I ordered this twice before from other places and got the wrong item and had to return it. Thank You Walmart for getting it right on the first try!
I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT THIS IS THE SLOWEST SHIPPING I HAVE EVER SEEN I AM STILL WAITTING FOR THE PRODECT
I liked this it
it all I use to help me keep my dentures secure.
It works wonderful
Wow! This REALLY keeps a good grip on my lower partial, no worries about it slipping.
Opened box n bamboo plant had a weird smell. Almost like urine. I decided to air it out n arrange the plant's limbs n see if in a few days the odor would subside. It did ! I haven't returned it because it's just too much work so it's in a corner in my living n I'm just trying to get use to it. Next time I will shop in person n buy a real plant. Not worth the price.
The tree itself is very nice. Not as full as I expected but I still love it. Completes the look of my tropical paradise. The only reason I gave 4 stars is it took a very long time for me to receive it. It was on backorder for almost 2 months.
Another Nearly Natural product that looks life-like. Works perfectly in our living room setting. This review was collected as part of a promotion. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The quality of the product is outstanding. This tree looks and feels natural without the care of a natural tree. I highly recommend you buy it, oh and the base is nice!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

The show is unique. I'll give it that. But just not the Sci-Fi show for me.
Not bad for futuristic show. Has some shortcomings, however good plot and shot of America are great. Still the characters, since they where adolescents, it was hard to believe that they ONLY they would be sent to try and establish "living" on earth without any other older characters.
Another series about what can happen after the apocolapse
A decent science fiction television series. Worth watching
Another good show from the CW I enjoy the story and the plot.
The first season is a bit rocky and over the top typical teen drama but once you get past the first half it really picks up. Season 2 is even better but after that it goes down hill fast. Much wasted potential.
An engaging and entertaining show. Well worth the buy.
This series is interesting and keeps you watching until the end. It was a great way to catch up with the series so we can watch season 2.
I liked the first season. Great characters, and story.
This show is quite entertaining to watch. Good cast and action.
Juvenile delinquents fight for survival in a Post-apocalyptic world.
Great quality, wonderful customer service, good price
i like the show and this way i have something to watch in the summer.
This is one of those shows were it's better to watch all at once.
one of the best T.V. Shows I have ever seen in the last year
Not a bad sci-fi series especially since its from the cw. The story line is kind of dumb but there is action and so many love triangles it's hard to keep everything straight. I only wish it could have been on a better network like amc or hbo.
I had to really power thru those first few episode but once I did I was rewarded with a great show. I love that it has great representation and makes you think.
Overall a good series. I did not see this when it was on but now have it scheduled to record.
Interesting Sci Fi show. Worth watching for sci fi fans.
I Enjoy the young cast of the show. To show how their survival modes kick in on this show. Very well written.
The 100 is a post apocalyptic sci-fi offering that has many elements typical of the genre. We start off about 100 years after the surface of the Earth was destroyed in an atomic war. Thirteen nations have orbital space stations and when the thirteenth is destroyed a truce is eventually called and the remaining station unite physically forming the Ark, what is presumed to be the last remnant of the human race. The Ark has a very dysfunction society were all crimes are punished by execution (floated out of an airlock). Juvenile offenders are reviewed at age of 18 and may be spared. Out story opens with Clarke being taken out of juvenile detention to be sent to Earth to see if the planet can support life, since the Ark is dying. Many elements of the first few episodes borrow from the Lord of the Flies and other science fiction works. The 100 find out in a matter of a few episodes that they are indeed not alone on the planet and the situation worsens on the Ark when over 300 people are "removed from the life support grid" which is polite language for them to be killed to allow the remaining people to live. The culling was voluntary but along with the political fighting that was shown and death of likable main characters revealed a very dark undertone at times in the series. The dark undertone was similar to Stargate Universe. We are left at the end of the season with the remnants of the 100 being taken to what appears to be a surviving military bunker. The ending of the first season has a deja vu appearance similar to Jeremiah season one. Overall a good sci-fi effort but only combines elements already seen in the genre with no new ground breaking plot or story lines so far. Look forward to season two. Blu Ray picture quality is excellent.
Excellent show with interesting characters and fast paced story line.
The 100 series is a good TV series to watch and follow.
Reasonable priced, fast delivery service and secured packaging. Can't wait for season 2 to come out.
Great movie for people who like sci-fi movies. Bought for my son
CW seems to have a good handle on concept series. This is set in the future where the future of humanity are living in a space state after a nuclear war. 100 juvenile delinquents are sent back to earth to see if they can survive and repopulate the earth. Interesting dynamics and mysteries between the people on the station vs earth.
An interesting plot and engaging characters make this show a cut above the usual CW fare. It's a binge-worthy trip you'll be glad you took.
This season is amazing nuclear power bomb that we'll written.
Both unflinchingly brutal but all to human this post apocalyptic thrill ride is well worth the the investment!
This TV Series is a real good show to watch, from start to finish.
Look past that its another teen apocalypse story and it actually is pretty good and keeps you engaged in the story line.
Action galore. Grabs your attention and holds onto it.
I liked this show from beginning to end. Lots of suspense
Just was just the beginning. What a fresh ifea to come to tv
This show is a of a kind. The cast is new and once you start watching you can't stop.
Fun show to watch when the series started. Keeps you interested.
We missed the first season. I'm glad we were able to purchase the 1st Season DVD. Wow it was fantastic.
I found this to be a refreshingly good series. Good acting and storyline. Going to buy season 2 and hope it keeps up
Great show hope this one runs for a while good story line and good actors
Finally a show that can keep me interested for more than just a half hour.
A group of 100 criminal teens get sent to earth from a space station . It gets better with each episode. The blu ray of this looks fabulous on my 50 inch plasma. Need to find the rest of the series on Blu ray.
I have liked The 100 since the beginning. There is no shortage of drama and action.
Excellent quality Blu-ray set.
Excellent price for an amazing show. Also comes with digital hd which it doesnt state but was a definent plus.
This DVD set arrived in a timely manner, and so far I am enjoying this series. I look forward to watching more.
Disk, show is very good, hope it last for many seasons. Shipping pass is wonderfull!!!
CW nailed it again with another great series. Suspensful, mysterious and dramatic show kept me wanting to watch another episode as soon as I finished the episode I was on.
Wasn't expecting this show to be that great, but I really like it...I have enjoyed it from the start! Can't wait to see what season 2 has in store for us!
Not a bad way to get rid of people who will not conform to the "MAN". :-)
Everyone needs to go get this show and watch it. It gets better and better as the seasons progress which usually doesn't happen with many TV shows. Most shows the seasons tend to get a little worse until the show is canceled but not this show.
It's nice to have something other than zombies destroying the world for once and I think the show will be on for a while. I haven't watched the CW in years, but found this show to be entertaining.
I have watched the first season on TV every week when the new one came on and so I had to buy the season when it came out, it's a really good series and it's different in many ways then others.
This is a great series, well thought of and very original, I was disappointed when I found out that they were going to cancel it. They always cancel good shows and keep garbage like "the bachelor" on the air, but the network brought it back for an even better second season, and the third is coming too. Awesome show.
I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother, and was very happy with the product received.
My picky adult boy likes this series so it must be good!
Story about populating earth again after nuclear war. It is highly rated!
Great new show, great story with mixture of space, apocalyptic surrounding and survival. Great extras as well
Great series and enjoyed catching up. can wait to own them all.
This show is an amazing rollercoaster of edge of your seat thrills and crazy twists and turns--you'll never see what's coming but you'll enjoy every second of it.
I got into this show when I ran out of things on netflix. I'm not usually a fan of shows from the CW because they are usually kind of terrible, or at least not great. I liked the idea of this show though. Kids get sent to a future earth where it is supposed to be uninhabitable. Definitely worth a try!
I first watched this on Netflix streaming looking for something new and was hooked. Had to buy it.
The 100 is like a fine wine: it's a show that only gets better with age. Although the first few episodes seem like typical CW-fare, the emotional stakes and characters continue to develop with each subsequent episode. The story beings when 100 juvenile delinquents are sent down from their space station to the war torn earth, to see if it is inhabitable many years after a nuclear apocalypse. Questions of morality, survival, sacrifice, and cultural politics are the central themes in the first season, and continue on for the rest of the show. The 100 dares to ask questions that other shows are too scared to even acknowledge. It's worth your time, for sure.In my opinion, the blu-ray release is the way to watch this show. With a gorgeous picture quality and an impressive audio track, you will get the most bang for your buck with this release. All 13 episodes from the first season are included in this set. But don't worry because season two is already out to marathon after you finish that intense and shocking cliffhanger at the end of the first season.
I bought this set as a Christmas gift to my sister and ended up watching the whole season with her.
I heard good things about this movie and I wasn't disappointed.
I love this new series. Please keep making these for many seasons.
Great series on blu ray! Been wanting it for a while now. Can't wait for the second season!
I couldn't wait till I could buy the entire season. Normally I wouldn't buy an entire season of any show. But I have to say this is the only tv series I have not had any bored moments of hurry up to some action than am interested in again.
I didn't know anything about this series when I purchased it. I thought the write-up on the back sounded good and seemed like something I would like. Just finished the 6th episode last night and it keeps getting better. If you like this sort of thing, you should enjoy!
Lot of action keeps you watching to the very end of the season
I enjoyed watching the season again. This program is very inventive and unique
My friend and I watched this entire show when it first aired and then purchased it and watched it all again just in time for season 2 to start. We love this show! This show has a little bit of romance/action/adventure/futuristic style to it if you like any combo of the aforementioned you will love this show!
Very nice first season I cant wait for the s3cond part
Great show at a great price. BestBuy still has the best deals.
Great show!!! A MUST GET FOR EVERY FAN OUT THERE!!!
If your looking for a show that changes it up you'll like this one
My son really enoyed it! We would recommend to all that like these kind of serious.
The 100 is well worth any sci-fi fan‚Äôs time, going all-in on its big concept and the many crisis that face its characters, both above and on the ground.
I didn't know what to expect from this show. I watched the first episode really enjoyed it and proceeded to read the book. Which I know now was a mistake and almost put me off the show but after starting episode two I ended up binging on the rest of the series. It's exciting and filled with a good looking and acting cast.
I wasn't sure what to expect from this show when I first saw a trailer for it, but season 1 was one of my favorite shows in recent memory. Really happy to have it on my shelf so I can marathon whenever I want.
Very good show. I like it a lot. Very good, thanks best buy.
It's a great way to catch up on the entire season couldn't take my eyes off of the DVDs they did a great job and it was reasonably priced it's the only place I could find it by it while you can!
This show is very well done and so far beyond what I would ever expect a show from CW to be like. Arrow, Flash, the 100..no wonder nobody watches nbc, cbs, or abc.
love this show, full of action and the making of it was great!
Great price for a blu Ray and overall great show!!
Another of CWs under the radar series. This is a great dysotopia series that fans of the genre will certainly enjoy. This is a can't miss show!
This is a great show. Sort of like a cross between lost and a space show. Great characters and acting.
The sentient bananas were a little weird, but still
Superb plot development elevated what could have been typical CW teen angst fare. Great SFX and worldbuilding made every new episode an improvement. No surprise really, given the presence of Jae Marchant, a former Dr. Who producer.
takes a bit to get going, but it is highly entertaining
I simply love it... You have to watch it.... First episode, I was hooked unto it, and can not stop wanting for more..
This is a better television show than I thought. Great DVD!
Great series on the CW, Full of twists and turns..
i really love the show and hope that the next season is even better than the first.
Great show. Nice that it comes with a digital copy.
It's a CW show so everyone is beautiful, but don't judge this show as just a bunch of pretty people. There is a lot going on and you can really have some complex issues to think about.
Awesome show !Like how they took the premise of Lord of the Flies and made it into this show.Season ended with a great twist.
I don't understand the varied reviews of this show. The "100" are juvenile delinquents released from their space station prison sentences to populate a radiated earth: earth is most likely not habitable. But down they go, and when they get to earth they not only experience a "planet" for the first time, but they also have just been released from prison. So imagine, 100 irresponsible criminals get dropped on an earth that hasn't seen a human in 97 years; you might expect to see some strange behavior and you do. The setting is pretty awesome, the characters are interesting and unless the writers completely drop the ball on the story, then you can expect a pretty good show. Also note, all the bad reviews have come from people who have just seen a single episode (who's expectations were probably unrealistic in the first place). This is one of the better pilots I have seen.
I watched the show when it aired on the CW and had to have it on DVD! I really love all the characters!
I will not give the shows plot away.in the top 10 best shows on tv. not better than some of the shows on hbo but very very good story line and picture is a 10
I would recommend watching it. It's an entertaining movie to watch.
Great show,good acting. It's just a good show from the beginning.
I love sci-fi ‚Äì and this show caught my attention. I would compare this show to be similar to Lost (which I also love), and Lord of the Fries. The characters are believable, even the "bad guys" ‚Äì the desperation and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive made that show more exciting. There are times that I actually had to pause to gather my nerve before I continued watching. The plot twists, here and there, made it more exciting. I know this is a TV show and not real life, I do feel sorry for the characters that they have to fend for themselves. I watched the original on Netflix, and now I have the opportunity to get a Blu-ray copy. (I did buy the DVD version of this, but I believe the compression rate was set too high, and there were parts that were pixelated.) I am hoping for the second season to go on sale, and I will buy that, too. If a sci-fi show with younger characters is for you, you will not be disappointed.
I really enjoyed this series. I watched it on Netflix and seen it on sale one day and purchased and started rewatching.
I was not aware this was even a show until my wife had purchased this series. I had seen it in passing through the room she was watching it in, but never gave it a chance until later.It is a great show about the human power struggle of survival at almost any means necessary. This is a good show that does not have to base everything around drugs or violence. Though there is a fair bit of violence.
Quick delivery, incredible price, and great for anyone who like psychological thrillers. There is action, romance, sci-fi, and the theme of difficult decisions to survive. There is something for everyone here!
Would highly recommend the first and second season of "The 100"
Definitely a YA show but its pretty interesting, plot is rather simple but not too boring. Thinking about getting second season when it goes on sale.
I love this show. Great plot, characters, and scenery.
Amazing series altogether on all different levels of science fiction things.
Awesome series about the future. Must see! Very well done.
Keeps you wanting more, I just keep wanting to watch the next episode or season
Great price. Digital copy make the Blu-Ray worth it. Must see tv. Leaves you wanting more each season.
Great science fiction series. I will definitely pick up the other seasons when they go on sale
Kinda heavy on teen drama but it's a fun campy show that has some pretty intense plot twists and quality television beyond what you would expect.
I found this at a price that could not be passed up . The fact that it was in blu Ray and included Digital copy clinched it for me. Not only did I get Best buy member points, But Best Buy sometimes have promotions running under Mypoints that give up to 3000 Mypoints for in store purchases. I received 200 for buying The 100.
I had never even seen this show when I bought it from Best Buy, but I took a chance on it since it was at such a great price. I am very happy I took that chance, as it's now one of my favorite TV shows currently airing! The show looks and sounds amazing on Blu-ray, and I can't wait to pick up the next two seasons on Blu-ray as well.
Bough it on sale here and love to finally have this set! I love it
One of the better tv shows on at the moment. Even my mom likes it which is amazing for a show with action and sci-fi
great season and cast story line is amazing would watch again and again
Going in, I expected another run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic teen drama. Well, it is that to some degree, but the writing so much better than the majority of what's out there. You grow to love characters that you originally disliked, and even become repulsed by a few of the likeable ones. Just as in real life, a character's actions can have deadly serious repercussions, but he or she may never actually see the consequences first hand. Main characters are constantly being muddied and bloodied physically and mentally, and at the end of the day the ramifications are real and none of them are above being killed off. When this realization sinks in, it truly makes for some very tense moments.
I binged watch both seasons in 2 days, suspenseful, exciting, and action packed series!!
My daughter and I watched it and we got hooked really quick. We watch shows like the originals, vampire diaries, walking dead, under the dome, defiance, revolution. Highly recommended
This has become one of my favorite series to watch on TV, the cast of people complement each to make a very enjoyable show.
I loved this movie. Can not wait for the follow-up seasons to be released. This is a Full Throttle movie
If you love Science Fiction show then this is for you!!
II'm not into TV shows but this one rocks, the characters are ones you can get to know. As the series progresses thru you ask yourself whats next the episodic style is awesome compared to the random episodes a lot of series do.. I recommend this show to anyone who wants to enjoy a good story and since this is only season 1 you'll b e like me at the end wanting to buy the next season to continue the adventure.
I loved this series so much I have purchased every season that comes out.
One of the best post apocalyptic series I've seen in a while.
One of the best t.v. shows out there. The stories are super exciting and really have you get involved. Great all around.
A post atomic world left from the ravages of nuclear extinction. A story of survivors trying to survive the world as it now is. A great bing watching series...
I was really pleasantly surprised how good this show is considering the books that it came from. Save yourself the time and skip the books and just watch the show. In fact I'd call it a must watch if you like either The Walking Dead or the The Road
Very suspenseful and edge of your seat show. I have not had much time to watch it but I like what I have seen.
Such an awesome show, glad I found it to add to my collection.
Season 1 is easily the best of the 3 seasons so far in my opinion. This bluray is excellent and is the first season of "100" youths exiled to a nucleur waste laden Earth (set in the not-to-distant future).
Love this Series, getting the other two seasons no
Great series with a lot of action and drama. Definitely worth watching.
One of my favorite tv series I finally found on blu ray and at a decent price.
I love sci-fi  and this show caught my attention. I would compare this show to be similar to Lost (which I also love), and Lord of the Fries. The characters are believable, even the "bad guys"  the desperation and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive made that show more exciting.

The 100 is well worth any sci-fi fans time, going all-in on its big concept and the many crisis that face its characters, both above and on the ground.
Love this product as it is not greasy and heavy feeling. The brown bottles seem to have a better scent than the white, waterproof bottles. For me, still the best product.
I've looked and looked, so glad I finally found this product, it is awesome.
For me this is the best suntan lotion on the market.
I use this product all season long. Keeps my skin moistured This review was collected as part of a promotion.
A friend recommended Austrailian Gold to me 4 years ago because my other lotion was causing rashes. No rashes with AG, and I will never use another tan lotion product.
I have used this for years but can't find the SPF 4 on the shelves unless it has bronzer in it. The bronzer is messy and stains. This one doesn't make a mess or stain.
I have been using this lotion for several years. So glad I can buy it online as it is not in stores.
I Love this product cannot find it anywhere so I decided to go directly to the website.. It was delivered in a timely fashion as well.. I'm very happy!
My family and I use this so much! It has great coverage, along with a tan, and smells great every spring break we stock up, but it never lasts!
I have used this since I was in 8th grade and still continue to. It is the best smelling lotion out there!
I love this product, but disappointed that I can't find it any place but on your website. keep this product!!!
I have used this tanning lotion for years, it has the best smell and keeps your skin soft.
This is the best product ever and is only available here
We love this lotion! The best smelling lotion on the market!!!!!
have been using SP4 for years wouldn't consider anything else
I am very pleased with this purchase. I cannot find this in any stores so I am happy that I can purchase this online.
I became a fan of Australian Gold years ago in Florida - it was not available at that time in CT so I managed to order it on line. Recently I notice this brand is in most discount and drug stores - but 4 is not so I looked at your website and delighted to see the array of products. I tan easily and 4 is just perfect for me - I get some protection and a very golden tan.
This is silky-smooth, easily absorbed sunscreen lotion with a light and fresh fragrance. My hubby loves it even more than I do and uses it more than I do!
I have been buying Australian Gold since around 1990 I believe. It's been so long I can't remember when I started buying it. It is the only lotion I will buy. I bought another kind way back when and I broke out in a rash and my face swelled up. Since using Australian Gold this has never happened. It keeps my skin moist and soft and I never feel dried out after being in the sun. I am a sun worshipper so I need to have some protection. I do not burn easy and find I like the 4 the best as I get a beautiful tan without burning. When out with my friends they are always using my lotion. Also I love the smell of the lotion. Everyone says I smell like a pina colada. I usually have on hand at least two or three and have a bottle in every beach bag. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been buying this for over 10 years. It id silky smooth and the coconut smell is fantastic. I would recommend this product to everyone. The best lotion on the market! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love this sunscreen so much that I use it daily for my body lotion!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Works great as a sunscreen, I also love the scent and not greasy This review was collected as part of a promotion.
In the summer we live outside! Once the deep tan has set in we still want sun protection that stays on and moisturizers. The only solution is Austrailan Gold SPF 4. The lotion keeps the darkest tan smooth and silky on the hottest days. Buy at least two for your beach days because everyone will borrow it! Best sun protection ever, based on over 45 years in the sun! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been using this 4 after I've built up my tan using a stronger SPF, and I know I'm getting my sun protection while smelling fabulous. Even when I'm not outside, I use the lotion to smell great. And, I get complements. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have used the 4 lotion for years, I tried 8 but it was to much block I never got a tanned. I boat 5 to 6 days a week in the sunny waters of South Florida, I prefer lotion over spray, it keeps the surrounding area cleaner with no over spray The only Drawback is the stores in my area that carries Australian gold only stock spray sunscreens The best product Australian Gold has is the Moisture Lock Tan Extender, this product stops the hurt of a bad sunburn and my skin turns into a tan the next day this product is a miracle works wonders
So very happy that you had what I was looking for. Love this product
I have been using this for years. It not only protects from the sun but leave your skin soft because it hydrates. Would never use anything else!
This is the best and only tanning lotion that I use. Stumbled across it several years ago while at the beaches and haven't used any other tanning lotion since. Gives you a fast and beautiful tan and it smells great! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have used the particular lotion for years. But it is nearly impossible to find in retail stores anymore. I am very happy to be able to order it directly from the company. This lotion does not have the bronzer in it so it does not make a mess on your swimwear and towel.
I have Native American blood and this lotion gives me the richest, golden, dark tan I have ever had. Plus my skin stays hydrated This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Just discovered this product. Will use as a year round total body moisturizer. Non greasy, goes on easy and just melts into your skin. The only draw back is that it has no availability in the traditional retail distribution channels.
I have been using Australian gold for several years and are very happy with the results.
I have been using this lotion for several years, this past year I can't find it at my local stores. I buy intone cruise ships whence cruise. I use SPF4 and reapply often. I have not burned and get allowing tan.
Use it every year for years now as sunscreen. Love it!
This lipstick stays on very well. It is very orange though.
I use to get this product from another company, but now that Lucky Vitamin sells it I will get it from here. The shipping is always quick and the price is very good
Your Hemp Organics Lipstick is perfect!!
I bought this for my mom, this is her favorite color and brand, she says it goes on well and has great staying power.
It is amazing how effective this is. My husband is allergic to our dog and she sleeps in our bedroom, so I kept this in our room. I could tell the difference when i had it on or off, the air was much purer with it on and if there was some kind of odor from our dog in our room the filter would get rid of it.
Overall a cute tongue in cheek comedy, with some decent cinematography at points but alas, it's like they took Expendables and actually tried too hard to not make it another Expendables.. Worth a rent on the dollar list.
Bought this because it was on sale because I enjoy most of the cast. Wasn't what I had expected, but not bad.
its a ok movie but it was a gift for somebody so I just bought it
Bought it on Black Friday, so the price was great. I like the movie as an easy to watch, typical shoot'em up movie.
I thought the movie was alright. I lost interest in it not even halfway through, but I did watch the whole thing. It does have action, but I prefer other movies over this one.
This movie was ok. Had to shut it off half way through. Red one was so much better. I was hesitant on watching the 2nd one and turns out I shouldn't have. The only thing good about the movie was that it was funny. For $7 or less watch it.
After seeing RED2 I wanted to see the first one because we enjoyed the second on so much. Was a little disappointed in the first one though as it is not as good as RED 2.
It's an alright action movie to watch once and awhile.
Would not buy the sequel. Just way too slow and rnding was bad.
Exciting and Funny. Can watch this several times. Terrific cast. Not too suspenseful.
Great cast! Action packed! Can't wait to see Red 2.
it is good movie, but not good as red 2. I saw red 2 first, and then want see red.
Good quality blu-ray with clear picture and sound. Reds is an amusing movie with a big star cast. Helen Mirren and John Malkovich are the most amusing and fun characters.
I had seen reviews of film but hadn't seen Red and it was humorous.
a funny movie with very good actors but confusing plot twists
Another comic book turns into a movie. But much more grown up than Superman.
This movie was entertaining, but not super great. Ok for a laugh.
Typical Bruce Willis movie. Lots of action with some funny one liners
A decent action movie to keep oneself entertained when not much else to do.
A movie for your parents who like older actors move to action film,
Before I bought the bluray I watched the movie a few times
Good movie and what a great price!! Best Buy has a great selection of awesome blu-ray at great prices.
Not the most impressive or exciting film, but it makes for an entertaining evening.
GREAT MOVIE BRUCE WILLIS IS GREAT LOVE THE PLOT THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE AT A GOOD PRICE
Fun action movie with a star cast which keeps things moving at a fast pace
Red is one of the few comic book adaptations that gets it right.
Great Movie. Much better than the Standard Blu-Ray. Supports both HDR and Dolby Vision.Picture: 4/5Auido: 4.5HDR: 3 /5Extras 3.5/5
Action movie with Bruce Willis. Has a different perspective from other action movies. Husband liked the Die Hard movies, so figured this would be a good stocking stuffer for Christmas.
Great action and actors/actresses. A lot of great laughs as well.
This is a fun show. Maybe a little mindless, but who doesn't enjoy those shows now and again?
Red is one of those comedic action flicks that it is easy to enjoy as long as you are not expecting anything deep plot-wise. That said, Red is an extremely fun film and is certain to entertain.The HD transfer is top notch with superb contrast and audio
RED is a fun, entertaining movie. Good action. Good comedy. Usually can't go wrong when Bruce Willis has to shoot stuff.
The movie has a great story line and established actors. The love story between Willis and the girl is nice, but, weird.Great action, explosions, and acting.... What more can you want! Waiting for Red 2 this year.
OK, so no academy awards here but just fun characters, great action, decent plot, excitement, etc. What else do you want? the cast sort of tells you what kind of movie this will be so without spoiling anything, if you can get it at a good price - pounce and add it to the collection.
movie is really good nice movie to watch with your friends
For a Willis action film, RED has the most well rounded cast to balance out his humor. Although I was NOT aware that this was a film-only BD, the movie is great, and I got it for a good price.
Great movie with a good cast!! I can watch this over and over again. Can't wait to see the sequel.
Willis as willis - this old guys were spies film is a lot of fun.. much more than I expected. Look for Bones from Trek as the CIA guy. Only really negative - Mary Louise Parker - can't act - not that pretty - how did she get in this movie?
All star actors in an action packed feature! The comedy fits well with the movie.
I loved this movie!! I know it didn't get great ratings on rotten tomato but I thought it was witty, sometimes silly, and filled with lots of fun action.
funny for an action movie. Would recommend to anyone that is a Bruce Willis fan.
Fun action movie with lots of star power, action, and fun.
I always found myself looking at this movie but something always happen just when I get into it. So I decided that I needed to buy it to fully understand what is going on. It's a great movie for those who love action movies.
This was a nice sequel to the original movie. I think I would enjoy a third movie with more of Helen Mirren.
After seeing it on TV I had to have it so I could watch it when ever I wanted. A fun movie night flick.
Funny action with a good plot to keep it going and tie it together.
This movie has a great cast of well known actors. They really ratchet up the action.
Enjoyed this, lots of good actors and fun story. Well done!
Fun movie at a great price. Have to admit I like Bruce Willlis.
An action movie starring Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren - how could I pass it up? RED is a rare blend of good banter, excellent acting, intelligent humor, and great action scenes. Highly recommended for the casual viewer and avid movie fanatics.
Saw this movie with the wife at the theater when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed it. So when it was recently on special for $3.99 just before Christmas, it was a no-brainer. Time for another movie night with the wife...and maybe the kids...nah.
This is a great action comedy with a good cast and has a great story behind it.
Decent adaptation of the graphic novel enjoyable popcorn flick
Great cast line up. Entertainingly funny. Good price.
I thoroughly enjoyed the movie with a great cast of actors. I enjoy most of the Bruce Willis movies with only a few exceptions. A lot of action with only a few corny moments... Overall good movie.
Great movie--great acting--great plot. A must see movie!!
My wife bought this movie for me as a Christmas gift.
I really liked this movie! Movie played great in my bluray player. No complains about loading times or playback. Action Movie!
Great film to find for ~$5. Aging Helen Mirren as a sniper is just a weird image, so I couldn't pass this up.
Very good movie, actors are great and the plot is unique.
Very good movie ,good story lots of action.Alot of good actors
Really funny movie. Very good acting and awesome action scenes!
I like it. It's fun to watch all these stars are having fun in it.
Good movie. Funny at times. There is a really cool fire fight with a 50 caliber machine gun. During the scene there is great camera and sound techniques
I enjoyed this movie. It is super fun to watch John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman what more could you want
I really like the actors, interaction, humor, and action. I liked it better than Red 2.
good movie to throw in and enjoy. great cast of classic awesome actors.
Thought it was going to be more violent or have more profanity than it did. The movie was better than I expected it to be.
If you like fast action Bruce Willis movies, this movie won't disappoint you.
This movie has lots of action in it. Kinda keeps you on your toes. Multiple artists keep it interesting also.
Entertaining movie. Lots of good actors. There is plenty of humor.
Gotta love bruce willis, mary louise parker, and john malkovich
I loved the first movie. This wasn't as good as the first movie but I really liked it. I think it's because of the actors involved in this movie. I would recommend it.
Red is a great movie for any fan of spy/action movies. Great cast, too!
This movie has a good balance of action and just the right amount of comedy to give it four stars.
I love the movie, love the plot and it was well casted.
Great movie! Lots of senior actors. Fun plot ... I want to grow up and be a agent too!
they had a great deal on the first one when they released the new one!
This movie is such a fun action adventure. Loved the actors and actresses.
A last minute purchase for a night of random action films and pizza. The dialog is witty, and the plot whimsical yet captivating. John Malkovich made me smile, Helen Mirror - what a vixen!
Funny movie with decent action. Love the Marvin character (John Malkovich),
Fun movie, very funny, great action sequences. Malkovich steals the show!
its a great part 2! Def not as good as the first, has some great funny and action scenes.
Exciting action movie. The actors did a great job and the story was thrilling.
Great to see these legends paired together in a cool acton picture like this one. The characters are very easy to identify with so the movie is engrossing and entertaining. Very cool movie.
I love all his movies so there is no reason to not watch this one. I say Red 2 is slightly better compare to this first one, but overall both movies worth a watch.
I like Bruce Willis movies, they'er funny with a good guy wins bad guy thing
The action and comedy was good plus I'm a fan of Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren
If you like to sit back and enjoy an action film, this one is for you.
Good movie for the action movie lover. Good to see these actors still making great movies.
This movie will not will any academy awards, but it's funny and entertaining. The kind of movie you could watch again and not know why.
I love this movie. Stellar cast that jells together VERY well onscreen. If you enjoy action movies with a ton of humor tied in, you will love this movie. There are so many subtle one liners that you will find yourself asking, "did I just hear that right?" and then bust out laughing.
must see good acting lots of action good ending and plot
A movie to watch and enjoy the action without a lot of thought needed. You got what is expected from the main leads, Willis, Freeman, Mirren etc, lately I've seen a bit of Karl Urban in a number of action movies and he does a good job as always. Fun to watch.
True over the top action and humor. The film surprised me
My army veterans loved this one they requested to watch it at least 2 times in 1 week
Funny and full of great action. Wonderful cast and plot.
It's a great story line. Retired CIA members who the CIA tries to kill but can't. The funny lines that come out between the actors is a classic. A good movie to laugh hour butt off
Happy with the Samsung smart tv for the price. easy functionality
Great movie with tons of laughs. Would recommend it for all ages.
Initially I resisted seeing this movie, but I turned it on and was surprised. Would recommend. Strong start although a little cartoonish towards the end. Still...worthwhile
The mixture of the cast and there missions makes for a story that led to what's next for the characters. I have both movies.
Interesting movie about ex CIA operatives. good acting by Bruce Willis.
Lots of dead bad guys. Kind of hokey. Probably was designed to be taken tongue in cheek. Helps us old people think we can still complete.
A funny, fun, action movie one of Bruce Willis best.
All the stars you want, all the action you need, and the laughs to seal the deal
a fun spy type movie that doesnt take itself too seriously
This was a good movie that was fun to watch about retired agents
Not for those who want to have a deep meaning experience
I like the one liners in the movie, particularly fro Bruce Willis. I like the whole setting for the movie
Lots of action in this movie. Great stars and fun to watch.
I really enjoy this show. It's not a thinker! Sit back, enjoy a bowl of popcorn and let it roll and don't think about it too much.
i really liked it a lot. it was money well spent :)
Loved this movie, and the cast is great. Seeing these folks work together in what I thought was a well though out plot was great.
The movie is good, funny, and action packed movie! My husband really likes the movie!
I wanted to add this movie to my collection, and the price was right.
It is funny. Great cast with one-liners in the script.
Fun story about retired spies returning to "business". Might work for family movie night if you don't mind blazing guns (bloodless though).
Hey,it'd a DVD,lol. Only can write so much about the quality ,which was fine.
This is a fun action movie with alot of familiar faces giving good performances. The special features are solid and the DVD is a great value for the price.
A good movie to kick back, relax and enjoy. The second one is better then this one if you haven't seen it yet.
I found the movie to be very enjoyable. It has a great cast of veterans actors.
I had seen RED2 before seeing the original RED film and enjoyed it a lot. This one was equally good, even though parts required a stretch to be conceivably real. You suspect they all had a blast making the film.
This is an action filled movie with an older crew and plenty of laughter in between
best bang for your buck.great action, great comedy.what more could you ask for?
It's a classic action /comedy. Big guns with some laughs thrown in
Great cast, this is a very well played out spy movie
This movie is fun. It has the good actors in it. Watch it and enjoy.
I liked this movie when it was released. Saw it on sale and added to library. Red 2 is just as good.
This is a very funny movie. There is some violence but it is done in a comical way and it is not violent like the movies of today.
Red has a sense of wit and whimsy as former agents are reunited against an unknown threat in their retirement.
Always fun to watch this film... very entertaining
The cast in this movie alone was enough to warrant purchasing this. The storyline was great and the dynamics between the characters was great. Cant wait to watch the sequel
Good Movie, fun to watch! Great action movie to watch
Surprisingly good! Action packed and quick moving.
Retired & Extremely Dangerous(RED) a funny title I thought but it was a good movie
Funny dialogue. And I liked all the actors in it. Not bad for retirees.
I love this movie!!! I had a very hard time finding a copy of this movie in stores on the day I wanted it. Best buy had it though. From now on they will be my first stop.
When I first saw this movie, I didn't have any expectations whatsoever, but after seeing it (several times), I can honestly say that this is move I love to watch. Just the right amount of action comedy and storyline.
I like when the older stars make movies it is always very interesting
Red is one of those films that gets better with each viewing. The cast, the story and the subject are flawless. It just gets better each time you see it.
Intelligently written action comedy doesn't disappoint
Nothing incredibly special about this other than the amazing cast, but it's totally fun and worth putting in for some mindless entertainment while you do other things over and over again.
Is a great action movie. My family and I enjoy very much.
Just a good movie all around. Funny with classic actors. Can't go wrong with this one.
Great movie and the price made it better. I would definitely purchase movies here again.
Funny movie with some old faces. Lots of fun and excitement.
Action packed, w/comedic attributes & big name actors/actresses !!!
RED is an action film with great performances by veteran actors, explosive action scenes, and plenty of humor. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and for those who like action but cringe at blood and gore, this is a great choice. This Blu-ray doesn't offer any special features, but for a nice home viewing experience, give RED a try.
The acting is good and there is a lot of action. The characters are very engaging.
This was a great action movie. The only drawback to me was it sometimes got in its own way trying to add an artsy edge, especially with the transitions between scenes. Still, definitely worth watching!
Love the fact Hollywood brought together these timeless actors for an action-packed, funny movie!
An oldie but a goody. Big guns with some laughs thrown in
Simply a fun story and a new take on the spy genera.
This is a fun movie with a great cast. Action filled with witty comments.
Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren are great. Loved the fast-paced action and the storyline between Bruce Willis and Mary Kay Parker.
It is definitely an action film and was glad that it was so cheap to buy since i've been wanting to see this for awhile.
I liked this movie a lot. Good to see a movie featuring some of the older actors done right. Shows that just because you're older doesn't mean you can't do a good action movie.
I had been looking for this since last year and I was happy to find it for only $8.00
Gave this as a gift. Found out after getting it that the Blue-ray edition was cheaper than DVD.
An amusing farce, but not really for the small children.
Action packed movie that will put a smile on your face.
This was a solid movie featuring a lot of great actors. The director did a great job of applying both humor and action to the plot and the characters carried the movie the rest of the way.
Great quality bluray for the price. I would purchase it again
fun movie great cast glad to have on blu-ray now!!!
Excellent item at an unbelievable price. Highly recommend! You should definitely buy it!
Fun and entertaining movie. Likeable characters. Not as good as the second but a solid foundation for the franchise.
The movie have a lot of action, that you will not get up from your seat
This movie is a great mix of action, comedy and even a little bit of romance. Bruce Willis is good as always, Helen Mirren is wonderful, and the rest of the cast is great as well.
movie was priced right. movie was priced right. movie
I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It has action, but also a very interesting story and characters.
movies are a good way to get out of real life and escape. this movie was good for that
It's action, comedy and Bruce Willis, need I say more! It's a witty action film with great actors that are not to old to let you know that they are still out here.
We watched this movie over and over. It was exciting and humorous.
This was pretty good , when the reties come together to protect each other . they they prove age is not a factor
We enjoy picking up the occasional movie on sale for times when we don't feel like watching television or our cable is out. Best Buy offers a good selection of older movies at a great price. And you can often find what you need by ordering online.
This action packed spy movie has comedy as well as great action fun.
An enjoyable movie with great actors. Definitely a good time watch.
great movie glad to own on blu-ray it now especially good price too
Good movie, great actors. Lots of action and comedy
Entertaining movie. A humorous story that the actors interact well with each other making for an enjoyable experience allowing you to forget reality for a couple of hours.
REDS is a great movie. Basically old farts that r still skilled at their old CIA jobs. It was on sale on Blu-ray so I snatched it up.
I wasn't too sure about this one since everyone was older and this was an action movie, but it was done with really good humor and still had plenty of action and entertainment. Surprised me in a good way, good movie!
This movie is so far fetched but it really cracks me up!
I love the tongue in cheek, dead pan humor of this movie. I assume it is the same in the graphic novel, but I have never read it.
Picked this up in the Blu Ray bargain bin. Great deal on a movie I can watch over and over!
This movie is an older, but good flic! Exceptional value for a Blu-ray!
This action-comedy has an all-star cast that works well together.
This is one fun & stylish action movie. If you liked OCEAN'S ELEVEN and THE MAN FROM U.NC.L.E., you get the idea. Two actors steal the show: John Malkovich with his insanity and Helen Mirren with her machine guns. The only drawback (not from the movie) is that the disc's audio is not lossless.
Great vehicle to feature these great stars in a fun action packed film
Fun spy humor for adults. A few clever twists for your afternoon entertainment.
Helen Mirren is an absolute bamf in this film. It's silly, and fun.
The action scenes in this movie are packed with some humors, this is a movie worth to watch and own.
An entertaining action / comedy with a wealth of good actors.
Good movie especially for fans of spy thrillers and CIA-type flicks. Bruce Willis is good here and so is the rest of the all-star cast. Definitely will watch this over and over.
Makes you laughs. Mary Louis Parker is so weird and funNY. I love the cast.
better is better.grate pitcherand sound.a must for a h.d.t.v.also glade that I added this to my t.v. package.would have been a mistake to not included it and at a good price
loved the concept of this flick. Retired CIA agents back in action. Excellent casting..Funny, action filled.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS FULL OF ACTION AND COMEDY. LOVED IT
Okay, if I must review--good movie for laughs
I purchased this product because I have seen this several times before, as well as RED 2 and I have enjoyed both, I think both are very good funny and action movies.
Very Good movie..Enjoy seeing all the famous and experienced Actors(s) doing this movie. Worth while
Once the 2nd Red came out, I realized how great the first movie was so wanted it for my collection.
No disappointment here. Loved this movie. I've watched it several times and will no doubt watch it more.
WYSIWYG
Can't beat ten bucks, even for a 3 year old movie. Was a new DVD. Came within the time frame Walmart gave (to the day). Movie is funny, witty dialogue, great actors and lots of great shoot em up scenes as well as some serious moments. Wanted to watch it again before going to see RED 2.
Works good and enjoyed the movie
Excellent movie, see second movie.
I lve this movie and just wanted an inexpensive DVD version. This did the trick!
This has many great aspects to it. It's hilarious, and full of action. Has the well known action actors in it, as well as some unexpected ones. Haven't seen the second one, but if it's anything like this one, I'd love it too.
I just really like this movie. Very tongue in cheek
Great movie with an excellent cast of legendary actors
A bunch of retired CIA/hitman types proving they aren't too old for this S kind of movie. A good balance of action, drama, and comedy.
Awesome movie. John Malkovich steals the show, he is hilarious.
Great overlooked movie and excellent rransfer to 4k.
Very good movie to watch on 4k and has Dolby Vision also.
Red is a great action film, with an awesome cast. The 4K transfer was very good and a significant upgrade from the blu ray disc.
Has a very good plot and super actors. One of my favorite movies.
You can tell all the actors had a great time making this. Good action, a lot of laughs and great chemistry between all the leads.
This is one of our family's favorite movies and now we can watch it whenever we want
I bought this on Black Friday without having seen it in theaters. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise, great plot, great casting, a very enjoyable movie.
Really enjoyed this movie and could not wait for the second one to be released. Great actors.
I enjoy almost every movie Bruce Willis is in. It's action and adventure with plenty of explosions and gun fights!
Hilarious! I recommend it to everyone. The cast is outstanding, they work so well together.
Really enjoyed the actors in this -had great characters to play! Starts a little slow, but once the first team comes to take out Bruce Willis' character -the action just go, go , goes! Loved John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman. The cast just really worked together well and made a great team.
Just a bunch of older actors, playing the part of older spies, put out to pasture. But, these older guys find themselves being bumped off, one by one. Their retaliation is a hoot to watch! It's exciting, funny, and makes you wonder why more movies aren't this entertaining?
watched five times so for, don't miss it, one of the best this year
Our family loves all the stars in this movie.It did not disappoint. The film had serious parts, humor and above all plenty of action.It's nice to see movies being released that don't depend on special effects to try to entertain.
THIS MOVIE IS JUST GREAT. A LOT OF ACTION. FIRST HALF BETTER THAN SECOND HALF.
Just seen the movie RED. It is the best movie I have seen so far. I love that Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis have teamed up again for another great movie. Love the action and the post cards with the greetings from... I love John Malkovich as Marvin and the pig that he brought with him. All around great action movie.
It's the perfect movie. Funny, exciting and a good plot. Yes it has a real plot, not just a bunch of special effects. Actors are great. It's a movie to rewatch every once and a while.
Loved the movie so much had to buy it. Great action/comedy
one of the best all around light hearted action movies of all time. perfect for someone who wants actions, but not all the gore that goes with most. my mom loves this movie, in fact, this copy was for her for mothers day. need i say more. love this movie, its always on the list for when company comes over or we just want something fun & exciting to watch
Good action movie to add to a collection. Loved the characters
RED is a great movie. It's entertaining without using nudity or lots of gutter language.
This is one of the best films where you can get all of some great old acting talent and put it to great use!!! This movie came out perfect! It must have with a second one coming out soon and it also is highly anticipatted!!
This is a great movie with lots of action. Lots of big time actors.
A creative movie with classic characters, bought for an excellent price!
Love the way that they've taken some of our aging stars and turned them into a bunch of bad ^$$es... Can't wait to see RED 2...
I love this movie and had to have it on BluRay. Great plot and awesome action!
Pure entertainment showing don't ever sneer about experience. The "old people" in this one shows how clever some of the older generation can be. Just pure entertainment.
I love this movie. To me, it is one of the better Bruce Willis movies.
exciting kick-butt action movie.Die Hard meets Cocoon
Great movie. Fast moving, always interesting. Lots of action but actually has a plot. Great seeing actors that we know in great rolls.
I think this movie has great potential to become a classic. It might not surpass other comic book movies but it definitely pulls its own weight.
Could not find this movie anywhere after seeing it on HBO. Thanks to Best Buys
I haven't felt as good watching a movie since 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean. Unexpected lines and juxtapositions lift this tale. Okay, so the story is very improbable...not to worry given that part of the movie experience is suspending our disbelief.Bruce Willis charms. John Malkovich is humorously irascible. Morgan Freeman gives us his usual likable best. Helen Mirren wields an assortment of guns. And Mary-Louise Parker shows us how facial expressions and muffled sounds can turn a story line and spice up a story.There's not a single member of Willis's reunited team I wouldn't like to be around. There they are, seeking first why Bruce Willis is in the crosshairs, then why seemingly random people are getting murdered and finally bringing the evil-doers to a just end.
The movie was very enjoyable, and I've recommended to others...
It was worth it see Helen Miren as an assassin....need I say more? But I will, the move is a roller coaster ride form city to city, and on top of action there's cheeky humor.
I suspect these great actors had as much fun making this film as I had watching it. Not a classic in the traditional sense
The only way to make this movie better is to buy it on Blu Ray! Great writing, no slow or dull spots, beautifully filmed action sequences, and the cast are just great together.
Good movie with humor and action to keep me entertained throughout
A fun over-the-top movie with lots of action and laughs
haven't seen it, but heard that its an amazing action movie. giving as a present.
I really enjoyed this action movie. Has a lot of older, fantastic actors in it.
I loved watching this movie. plenty of twist and turns, to keep you watching the out come. all the actors did well. I'm glad they made a part 2 for the movie. I hope they continue making more parts for this movie.
I love all Bruce WIllis movies, this one is no exception. Him and Morgan Freeman were great together. Looking forward to RED 2. You will enjoy this movie.
Bruce Willis and John Malkovich are great in this movie. It is full of action but has great one liners through out the film.
Loved the movie. My husbands favorite series of movies.
One of the better spy movies out there. I bought it because my wife wanted to see Red 2, and I felt it would be better to see the first movie first. It's one of the few movies I own that I've watched more than twice.
excellent movie with alot of action . the plot is believable, where the actors make you laugh out loud.
Fantastic Spy film about the CIA trying unsuccessfully to "retire" some of their retired operatives... Great action and humor by entire cast!
I orderd on line and picked it up at the CS Desk at BB great system. they were friendly at the Morrow Ga BB store
I orderd on line and picked it up at the CS Desk at BB great system. they were friendly at the Morrow GA store
This movie is one of those gems mixing humor, action, and bits of drama. It was a must have for my movie collection. John Malkovich was the best.
Bruce Willis is great in this movie. Good movie with humor & lots of action.
Very satisfactory very very good products! Very very good,,,',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I first saw this movie at the theatre and it was very entertaining. Watching these more mature actors in an action movie was fun.
Awesome movie, hands down. Great action with a little comedy
I really enjoyed watching this film. I was fast paced and never lack for action. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the show. Get it yourself and see. Very funny as well.
bought it for my boyfriend. he enjoyed it. happy with the price and how quickly it arrived.
Good cast and very funny action film.Worth watching again
It is a creative spin on secret agent work. The actors played their parts perfectly, especially John Malkovich.
Great movie that is funny and action packed. the second red movie is just as good too.
Great variety of actors!, great action!, humorous!
The cast made this one of the most fun movies I've seen. You come to expect action from Bruce Willis, but Helen Mirren was soooo good
I wasn't expecting too much from this film but I was pleasantly surprised by this great little movie.The amazing cast helps drives this film along and the idea of an aging team of assassins lends itself to some great comedy moments that sit nicely alongside the action scenes.
funny movie, my daughter who loves pigs loves the part with "open the pig"
Good movie, very funny most of the time, I like all the actors in this movie.
A great movie, very funny with lot's of action. 'the way the relationship between the main characters is funny and makes you want to root for them to be together.
love the movie and ability to get it at a great price!
The Movie was great with the action and shooting people.
I loved this movie. Everyone is wonderful in his (or her) part. Can't wait to see RED 2.
good movie, plenty of action and intrigue, interesting plot twists
I liked the movie but the first was a lot better. I was not expecting a lot because it was a sequel. It is worth a watch.
I like the idea that getting old doesnt mean you gotta slow down, just another chapter in life
Great movie, Bruce Willis does fantastic as always. Karl Urban was a surprise hit for me in this movie doing a fantastic job. Much better than red 2.
RED is a great movie with an All-Star cast. All the actors portray their characters flawlessly and make this an easy watch for anyone wanting to have a good time watching a movie.
This is a very good movie. It does stray a little but is a joy to watch. I just don't like that there are no deleted scenes or outtakes on this disk. The DVD version at least has one deleted scene on it. But was worth buying.
Bruce Willis fan and always like his movies. Lots of Action.
the characters provided an explosive return to be the best
Lots of action and full of humor. It was very entertaining.
Great movie. Great plot. Great price. It's a great movie to own.
Plays very nice! Great picture and film! recommend to everyone!
Great fun with these older actors. John M. can be menacing, but here he is hilarious. No oscar contender but great to watch
On of my favorite Bruce willis movies. I enjoyed all the action and well placed jokes
Had seen this and wanted a copy of my own. Good comedy that really pokes fun at the various spy networks and countries.
Great movie, much better then the sequel. I definitely recommend this if you have not seen it yet.
I loved this movie since I first saw it and have been looking for it for a long time at a great price and I did!
This is a great movie, hope the sequel lives up to this.
Best second movie I have seen - better than the original RED.. and I liked that movie. Funny flick keeps your attention and never stops with the action!
What a hoot! A bunch of Retired, Extremely, Dangerous operatives get to make the "New Kids on the Block" look foolish & take care of the bad guys at the same time!
Such a good movie, had to buy to watch it over & over.
Great cast, good story and after watching the movie, had to purchase Red2 to see what happened next!
I love a great comedy, the cast of this movie was all top notch actors and really worked great together
We love this movie! The plot is good with a lot of twists and turns that are often delivered in humorous ways. Yet the humor only adds to the plot and doesn't detract from the basic story line as with lots of comedy. The humor is understated and not slapstick or overdone as with some comedies. This is a great show!
I loved the movie, I thought 2 was even better than 1 not sure if they will make another one, but I hope so.
Good movie in general. Shows off the capabilities of a home theater system!
This movie was a great one to add to my collection! The combination of Willis and Malkovitch is hysterical. The action was just perfect and the story line was cute. And was even better after they made the sequel!
Great story with comedy, action, good story, great actors, and even a touch of romance...kinda. Bruce is great, but everyone seems to be having so much fun that everyone is stealing the show from him. It makes for some great ensemble and a movie to watch and rewatch.
It's good action/comedy about retired spies or agents getting back into working to help a fellow spy who's also retired. They have elite skills and give active agents a run for there money...It has a lot of funny scenes... It's a movie that could be watched over and over.
This is a very funny movie with great actors. There is a lot of action, some of it funny and over the top.
It is very good DVD. I think Sound and resolution is good.
Great dc comic conver to movie. if you like Bruce Willis you will like this. John Malkovich is great.
I saw Red 2 first and had to get this movie just because the second is awesome. Red 1 lives up to my expectations and more!
Red is a great movie. Hilarious plot and love all the actors.
Fun Movie with great action, plot and wonderful cast. The pace was great and the special effects were pretty spectacular.
I enjoyed watching it and have seen it already twice.I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis.
A great sequel if you enjoyed the first installment. Entertaining action and story.
Great movie! I would recommend this movie to everyone.
I LOVE this movie!! The cast is fantastic and the chemistry between them is wonderful. We laughed (and almost cried) through the movie. This movie is worth seeing over and over again! All of the cast give 100%!!!
Special features makes this worth the price ($5). Check out the deleted scenes.
One of those surprisingly unexpected awesome action/comedy movies that I thought was going to be boring because of the over powered cast. It turns out to be funny with some good action.
This movie caught me by surprise when I saw it on cable.I had no idea what it was all about when I watched it (nothing else was on) and I got sucked in! Who says ya gotta be a washed up-has been just because your age has moved north of fifty?!?? Young people take a hint.It's called EXPERIENCE BABY (and LOTS OF IT in the case of this cast!)
Bought this dvd for my dad for Christmas and the whole family loved it!
Bought this movie for my Dad and he seemed to really enjoy it.
This movie isn't just a good movie it aslo has alot of great actors...Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis ect. Even better I got it for less then $10!!!
This is a great movie with a great cast and great dialogue. It's also one of those rare instances where the sequel is better than the first.
Most modern comedies are rather tepid when it comes down to it; this one is absolutely hilarious. It also has some of my favourite actors, like Karl Urban and Helen Mirren.
Love this movie. It had to grow on me but I think it is hilarious.
From start to finish this movie will keep you entertained. It has excitement, humor, love, laughter. It has it all.
This video/movie is worth buying and viewing. It is fast moving and fun to watch. You're not always sure what's going to happen next. The actors are fantastic.
The move is enjoyable while being different. The characters are great with exceptional actors portraying each.
I was surprised after all of the ads about this movie that it really was as good as they said it would be. Best action movie Bruce Willis has made.
Great movie. When the second movie came out I had to go see it at the theater. Lots of action and surprises, as well as some great humor.
This movie and its sequel are great additions to any video library. It's fast, funny and has a great plot that's executed by very talented stars.
This was a fun movie to watch, just the right blend of comedy and action.
Great movie for any agegroup. John Malkovich is hilarious.
LIked this and its predecessor! Good buy to re-watch! Keeps your attention as well as entertaining.
I had to watch this 3 times, and loved it each time. So funny!
This is a very enjoyable movie, not recommended for young children, however a very entertaining movie with high quality actors.
Great movie, Bruce Willis doing some great acting and I love the pig.
Since the movie RED2 came out I wanted to watch RED but I couldn't find it until I looked at Best Buy. When I saw it I had to have it. Excellent movie.
This movie was alot funnier than I thought it would have been. Love watching it.
I enjoyed both Red movies. For the same reasons. Great plot, acting and directing. Hope there will be a Red 3
Enjoyed the movie with great headliner actors, lots of action and humor.
Great movie, only surpassed by the sequel, Red 2.Humor is delicious, especially in light of each character.
Love this movie! Great plot and funny throughout. There is violence and language but otherwise its a clean movie.
Have RED 1 & 2, and are both full of action with a good plot.
Action filled fun, very enjoyable, now need to get Red 2
LOVE THIS MOVIE AS WELL AS IT'S SEQUEL! I'm a huge Bruce Willis fan though so I'm easy to please when it comes to him.
great movie, kept me entertained throughout the whole thing!
I love the cast and the movie was very action packed and some funny adult humor.
John Malcovich and Bruce Willis are hilarious in this first of two movies. The whole family watched while laughing throughout the movie. Would watch over and over.
This is a fantastic movie filled with great humor and action! A must see!
My husband and I both really like this movie. It's got the action for him and the humor for me.
Great movie, has all the right elements: violence, humor and intrigue. They did this one right!
I enjoyed this movie because it has action and humor. My elderly step dad thought it was too violent.
Fan of Bruce Willis moviesa friend recommended this one to watch! Plenty of action and comedyworth watching over again!
We LOVE this movie!! The cast is fantastic and the chemistry between them is wonderful. We laughed (and almost cried) through the movie. This movie is worth seeing over and over again! All of the cast give 100%!!!
I enjoyed the action and the actors in this movie! It was very enjoyable
This was great movie for guys. It has action and comedy put together very well.
I really like this movie. The pacing is good, there is a lot of action, and humor. The actors are very good and the plot is interesting.
I was only going watch this movie because it had John Malkovich, but was really impressed how the movie worked out. I had never read the comic books so i don't know if it stayed true to its origin. Would recommend to everyone,not matter what their movie preference is.
Great movie with an all-star cast. Worth watching multiple times
Great Movie...enjoyed it with my husband and family
I love this movie. It is action packed movie that doesn't take itself to seriously. I laughed and enjoyed the story. Not to mention the action and acting is top notch.
Excellent movies to add to my collection, Intersting twist at the beginnning and action and himor was great
Good pic quality.Good pic qualityGood pic quality.Good pic qualityGood pic quality.Good pic quality
Love this movie. This was an action packed movie with plenty of comedy to make it worth while to own! Great movie to watch at anytime.
This movie is hilarious from opening to closing credits. It definitely is an unusual ensemble cast, but the chemistry really works. It's a must see action movie.
Fun movie , like the characters and story line. Like the sequel too.
Keeps your interest during the entire movie, lots of fun to watch
Every character is perfect! Each cast member delivers an engaging performance that drew me in and kept me wanting more. The surprises and twists made for great entertainment. If you like action and comedy, you will love this! Better than the "Die Hard" series of films from Bruce Willis!
The movie is a refreshing change from the intense Shooting and Chasing in action flicks. The added humor in this movie is really refreshing!! The only thing better is RED2!!
Saw this at the theater when it released, had to own it...now own it and its nearly equal sequel: RED 2. I wont go into plot, action, or such critical review of the movie, we all know there are better places for those details. However, suffice it to say that this movie delivers and the disc does not disappoint...a must have for the avid movie collector.
Awesome cast and the plot and action are great! I would recommend this movie to all.
This is a funny, well written and action packed film! The chemistry with the cast makes it even better!!!
This movie has everything. Action, drama and comedy. 4 stars
This movie is funny, has action and a love story for those that like that. Great story also
If you like Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and John Malkovich and you love action movies you should pick up this one!
Action drama intrigue all those things a guy needs and enough for the ladies so they'll watch it with you.
Lots of action great actors,was very entertaining,drama with some comedy made good story line
Talking ABOUT funny high intensity scenes sharp vivid photographer shots where they filmed gorgeous landscapes bruce Willis funny as ever
loved the movie, loved the price, great customer service
One of the few start studded movies that showed the best talents of each star.
I enjoyed "Red", it has some old school themes to it. The characters are all names that we've watched on the screen for years and it's nice to see how they have matured and still remained fun to watch. I'm looking forward to "Red 2", the trailers look good so far.
Liked the whole cast and hope there is a third movie ...
Action, Action and more Action. This is a must have.
Good movie. Good quality. Runs great after one year.
bruce is good in red so is the rest of the cast The action is of the chain.
Best Bruce Willis movie since die hard. Great cast and funny movie
This is by far one of the best movies ever. I know I've seen it about 50 times since it came out.
Bought both this and Reds 2 at the same time (figuring we needed back ground for 2 and we had been told 2 was better, so we figured we needed both.) Actualy liked 1 better than 2. Bruce Willis is great in both though.
I rented the sequel and laughed so hard watching it. I just had to go buy the first installment to see how it all began. John Malkovich's character is by far my favorite. "I'm getting the pig!"
Great movie! Lots of famous people in it. Makes for a great show
ENJOYED IT ADDED IT TO MY HOME COLLECTION,LOVE VIN DIESEL
It's a great action packed movie. I loved it. It was very unpredictable.
Excellent cast. Great acting. A great comedic action film.
I love this actors, even they're getting old ; they still awesome
Action packed and comical! Can't get any better than that!
Red is a great take on what happens to semi-retired spies or mercenaries. Does anyone ask that? of course, and here's one answer. Deftly written, characters are endearing and quirky. Bruce is great. Helen is tremendous. John M is creative and crazy. So much fun, and then there's the equally great sequel. Get them both.
This movie is hilarious!!! And you can't beat the all-star cast. Definitely recommended and a family favorite. Warning: there is quite a bit of violence.
Love this movie. Since my daughter snaked my copy on dvd, i picked up the bluray version.
Excellent casting, very funny at times, lots of action. Great cast
I kept missing this movie on Fios so I finally got to watch it even though I had already seen the sequel.
The movie was awesome, it was in stock at the store and the price was very fair.
Action packed and full of edge of your seat thrills.
Great new spin on the idea of the spy who leaves retirement and comes back to settle old scores. Right combination of action and comedy, does not take itself to seriously.
Hilarious movie that brings a new meaning to the words Old School. Kept me watching and laughing the whole time.
The story line was full of surprises and the actors were great!
Action movie x-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccccccxcc
I can enjoy watching this movie multiple times. I am glad to have added it to my collection.
Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis, Very Good Story and Action, I will buy Red 2
I can watch this movie over and over again. It has action and suspense and witty characters. It's great entertainment!
Bruce Willis at home in another action role meant for him.
If you need a great laugh with great action and comedy this is the movie for you!
I am not into action packed movies but I must say I loved this one! The subtle pieces of comedy really add to the movie as well. I have watched this over and over! Definitely worth purchasing. I then rented Red 2 and it did not disappoint.
Great movie and got it for a great price. Highly recommend!
Great movie. So much fun to see an older group of actors do such a fun movie with so many little interesting plot twists. Really enjoyed this movie.
Fantastic cast! Awesome actors come together and provide a well rounded movie with humor and action. Excellent job!
I enjoyed the Reds 2 but this is my go to version.
The movie was great. The DVD worked properly and the price was right.
I got this for the action and it delivered the whole time.
This top rated cast presents a fast paced scenerio. Gets tension flowing.
This is a great action packed movie. Bruce Willis is great.
If you like the amazing cast, you will like Red...a well executed comedy/action movie. It's a steal at Best Buy while the sale lasts!
the cast helen mirren ,bruce willis is amazing . morgan freeman
Always has been one of my favorite movies. Got it on sale at my local best buy and I'm happy to have bought!
I like this movie because it is funny but is an action film as well. It's a good mix of humor and action.
RED is a terrific fast paced and well acted movie with terrific actors creating great characters.
Great movie. Love Bruce Willis. All the movies are good but this one is great.

Terrific movie. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!
GREAT CAST. WELL PACED. VERY ENTERTAINING.AN INCREDIBLE ROLE FOR HELEN MIRREN

It is a great movie that I enjoyed watching. I would recommend it to my freinds
I have been putting seeing this movie off for a while. Im glad I purchased it. Now I want to see part two.
One of the years best movies. Bruce Willis is a comic
lots of fun actions. these actors are great together.
Excellent image quality, easy to setup using provided documentation and setup disk.. Flexible computer connectivity using either a VGA or HDMI cable. I chose to use a HDMI cable. Monitor image very detailed from edge to edge. I was able adjust display image to my liking using ample on-board monitor controls. Sales representative was very helpful and well informed on product specifications. I am very satisfied with this product.
It turned out to be really good. Bruce Willis did a great job.
Hey any movie with Bruce Willis, and the rest is all right in my book.
Love this movie, lots of action and comedy. The actors are great
I live Bruce Willis and he didn't let me down in this movie
This is a great movie. Loved Helen Mirren and there is a lot of action and it is also very funny!
This movie is so full of high caliber action stars, that even just the sound of it makes it the best ever. Witty and action packed. Perfect combo
Action filled and hilarious. Enjoyable action film.
Movie was good, it had a lot of action and it was funny as well.
This is a non stop action movie. Bruce willis is still one of a kind actor.
One of the better movies. DVDs are the way to go, unlike dinosaur VCR tapes.
I highly recommend this movie, great cast and action
I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone. This movie is very entertaining. Helen Mirren steals the show!!!
Funny movie, definitely one of my favorites. Red 2 is also good!
I don't know how this slipped past me in the theaters. It was very funny and entertaining.
get this movie. If you like it, Then you will really like RED 2
Fun movie with lots of big stars. Even my teenagers liked it.
Both "RED" and "RED 2" are among my most favorite movies!
Can beat the Great prices and service was fast and friendly.
Awesome movie with a lot of action and good actors.
My husband loves this movie so much, I got it in Blu-Ray for him as an anniversary gift.
Cute, funny, action packed, loved it..............
Plenty of action. I enjoyed this movie. I would recommend this movie if you like action.
Both Red and Red 2 are very entertaining with a great cast.
He loved it... I'm thinking of coming to buy Red 2
bruce willis is so good in this movie i really think this is a movie you check out
WE bought RED 2 and liked enough to get the first one. Helen Mirren is awesome.
I had this movie on dad and had to have it on bluray. Such a great movie.
This is A good movie for the whole family! And red 2 is just as good. We loved it.
This movie is highly entertaining. Always a good time.
I've been waiting to buy this movie but it was on a whim. I've enjoyed it immensely. Got to love Bruce Willis.
A thriller with a great cast, definitely recommend.
This is one of my favorite movies. I'm hoping that they will ome out with number 3.
Great Movie to add to our collection. Great customer Service!
Opening Scene: The mundane daily routine of a retired CIA Covert Operative is exposed  it was routine. The show is most likely one of the best spy  counter spy flicks that I have seen. With a superb blend of senior casting, sensitive directorship, and a very well-written plot-line of pure table-pounding action/intrigue entertainment this is the type of film you will visit again, and there is a twist around every corner that is guaranteed to keep your interest up! It is interesting that the plots star character, Frank [Francis], is a pure romantic with a hard exterior but is soft and gooey on the inside.
This movie is great. You have fighting, people blowing up stuff, and humor. My kind of film
Red and Red2 are awesome! I loved seeing these actors. It was great to see actors as they age. They still have so much to offer in good movies!
Red is a goofball movie. "It's saying that in the good old days, or at least in the good old movie days, our killers were good-time guys."
great movie very action packed and just exciting in general
I watched Red 2 before the first one. Red is a great movie with action and humor.
John malkokvich is so funny in this especially when he bats a gernade
Great action movie, with a great story. A must buy if you are a fan of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman or Helen Mirren.
Loved this movie and found it on a fabulous sale. Couldn't pass it up. Hilarious and action packed.
a good action/comedy movie. always love how morgan freeman acts
Lots of fun and action. Sometimes, I got the impression that the entire script was played tongue-in-cheek, but it's more than that.
An all star cast that will make you laugh and leaving you wanting to see it again.
Some movies you watch once and then never again. This movie you can watch over and over and always see something new to laugh at.
Action pack movie. Has some funny parts to the movie, but really enjoyed it. Old friends coming together after a long time. Must watch!
I had heard about this movie when it was in theaters. Everyone who saw it said it was great. It was on sale and I purchased it and it was a very good movie and can be watched again instead of just once in a theater.
A Great Blu-Ray movie! This is one to have in hand.
Great movie. Very entertaining. You won't be disappointed.
I highly recommend checking out the bins at the end of the movie aisles for great deals on classic movies at reduced prices. I have found some of my favorite movies here.
Great! Got on clearance, so was a good deal for me.
Whoever did the casting for this movie should get an award. An unlikely crew with an unlikely story add up to some great laughs and lots of action. Malkovich's character is hilarious!
Had to by this movie Bruce willis is one of my favorite actors
Picked it up for $4.99 sale to add to my collection. Have always loved this movie.
I love the movie and its a great quality disc. Best Buy always has great deals.
Great characters, good action, fun movie to watch.
I got this movie in the clearance bin, and really enjoy it.
My Mom raved about this movie. I wouldn't have seen it if she hadn't recommended it.Fun!
Great movie that we have loved for years. Bought the movie to add to our blue ray collection. Would recommend it for everyone
Enjoyable, my wife loves watching this movie. Fun, some violence, language not over done in swearing. We watch it again and again.
It is rare to find a movie that is packed with so many stars of the screen and is not a movie in which the stars carry a flimsy or non existent story line (script). This movie Red has a solid script and story line and so many stars of the screen that I had to take my shoes off and use my toes to count all of them. I found it amazing that none of the stars stole the screen over the others and the camera loved watching them work together a team to provide a very rich experience that sucked me into the movie.
Awesome movie. Lots of great action and funny scenes.
Love the Red movies. They are exciting and fun. It was on sale and cheaper to buy than rent.
Great Movie!!!! But it! Very funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This movie is great, and finding it at such a low price made our weekend perfect!!
We have enjoyed this action packed movie and all the actors in it!
We love this movie. We have purchased it several times because games and movies seem to grow feet at my house.
I recommend this to anyone looking to enhance their blue ray collection
Good movie - great story - lots of action - can't go wrong
Bought the first one and love it. The second one is even better.
found movie in clearances bin . very happy I bought it
I admit when I first watched this movie I didn't expect much. I think I went to see it at a dollar theater to pass some time but it turned out to be a really fun trip. I found this in the bargain bin at Best Buy during Christmas and decided to get it for a family member since I figured they (like me) would not have sought it out on their own.
Best action/comedy I've seen for a while. Excellent price
Great Characters, Movie, Plot. It has it all. In fact I would recommend Red 2.Entertaining and Enjoyable. All you could want for a Movie Night.
I really enjoyed this movie which is why I bought this copy on blu-ray. The price was very affordable.
I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time. I saw it on sale and realized I had some free time. I had a Red/Red2 marathon. They are now two of my favorite films!
This is a funny yet still a awesome movie with plenty of action, cant wait to watch the 2nd one.
it jas alot of adventure and great movie and would recommend to friends
One of the best movies geared toward the older audiences! Even my kids love it!
My wife loves this movie so we had to buy it, not many movies that I enjoy that she likes to watch
Cool movie with a fun story attached. Great movie for bringing in the truly great actors
Just adding to the collection. Was on sale for $3.00
This movie is funny and exciting and full of action. I love that the actors are older spies. They work so well with each other so that you believe that they have known each other for a long time. This adds to the story and pulls you in.
Great movie i would reccomend it to a friend. Best buy always has a great selection of movies.
Love it! Everyone should watch this! It is really good.
As the first of 2 so far, this is excellent. Great action. Keeps you wondering how it's going to end. Enjoyed it a lot.
Great balance of humor and action. Many talented stars.
John Malkovich is at his weirdest best in this action packed thriller.
Good movie with a good cast and plenty of twists in the plot.
This is just a funny movie. How can anyone not recommended this
This is a really great movie. It is very enjoyable. The 2nd one is not as good.
What's not to love with a cast like this and all that action
The movie was good and customer service was excellent.
All the elements of an action film along with biting humor and sarcasm.
If you retire well and stay in the swing of things, you, too can... well, if you were a 007 level operative, you can keep a semblance of your youth. AT least for this team....
This is a great action move but like the storyline as well.
This movie was very funny and shows the lighter side of some great actors/actresses. Though some may view the plot as dubious, that is not the reason for watching this film. Watch these great folks deliver some really funny stuff.
This movie is a great comedy with a brilliant cast of characters. It is great to see an action film made into a comedy.
A very excellent and entertaining movie. It is pure entertainment.
I loved all the actors in this humor tinged thrill ride
I enjoy this action pack movie. I also love the humor!! You can watch this movie many times.
Great movie. Great story. Great cast. Funny and action packed.
I've never seen it till we got it. Its not bad at all
I was looking for this terrific movie at a discount and Best Buy came through AGAIN!!! I watch it whenever I need a laugh.
The actors flow so well together. I have watched part one and two and they are both entertaining
If you liked the movie on a regular DVD, it's even better on Blu-ray. All of the action is right in your face.
The characters are all familiar and in some cases play an unexpected roll. The end is not surprising but the path taken keeps you on your toes and completely involved. Bruce Willis is predictable and his "older friends" are all playing their characters extremely well. I would recommend this for people from teens to old age. Actually purchased a second copy for a friend.
I had never heard of these movies and decided to give it a try. Well, this is a definite must see! The cast is fantastic! There is so much action you will never be bored! Make sure you see all of them....
This movie is really action packed, I'm so looking forward to the sequel!
the movie is very entertaining.great suspence and funny after all
Super action and comedy in one. The cast was exceptional. Wish Morgan freedman didn't die but brave sole took one for the team.
I love this show. It kept my interest and the characters interacted well. I'm glad I was able to get it on Blu Ray.
Really............................ Funny.........................
Red is a very good movie, made even better on Blu-ray !
I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and loved it. Now I need the 2nd one.
Full of action pack and funny, like the actors in it too.
This is one of my favorite movies. This movie has a really good story and is very funny. Bruce Willis is awesome and John Malkovich is hysterical. Would be a good date night movie, too.
Some of the funniest stuff. John Malkovich is hilarious!!
Enjoyed with 2 12-year old sons. Top notch cast. Recommended.
good film, came well packaged, disc worked first time, good vfm...
Pay attention this movie is great watch it over and over again
A fantastic rip roaring jaunt. Very funny and action packed.
great action. very funny. great cast. this is a must buy.
Very Good Entertainment. The Cast is Outstanding and John Malkovitch is Hilarious.
Another one for my library and my girlfriend really likes this movie and we both love Morgan Freeman
Watched the 2nd before the first and I love this movie.
I love action movies, well, ones with an actual plot. I had a rewards certificate and saw this in a value bin, and figured why not? Helen Mirren's character is my favorite part in this movie. I generally love any woman who can kick some butt.
Great movie, allstar cast, one of my favorites, highly recommended
We borrowed this DVD from the library, and when I saw it at such a great price I got it to enjoy many more times. It has a lot of action and humor.
Bought this one and Red 2 sight unseen - almost for the cast alone. Fun movie(s) with lots of action and great dialogue. Watch the bloopers- definitely worth it.
I enjoy movies starring Bruce Willis and this one is definitely no exception to that.
Love the characters they throw some humor in the movie so it makes it more enjoyable.
I love this movie and that cast that is in it. Action Packed.
I bought RED and RED2 together since I really like the storyline and action scenes.
Great cast, lots of action. Good movie. Sales price was good.
This movie is VERY violent and VERY funny. Great cast, good one liners, and fun story all around.
Another solid winner staring Bruce Willis...you can't go wrong with this one!!
awesome find and there so many to choose from. great movies at sweet price
it is a very funny and action movie i am really like it
I've often wondered what happens to retired spies? This movie is one option....
I liked it a lot, I'll see it a few more times, save it too see it again . ...... Exciting, fast, humorous . .....
Good movie and definitely worth the price, since it was in the $5 bin. :)
Great movie n price glad to add this to my collection and watch over n over
Good price. Action and comedy mix. Definitely worth it
Great actors, funny scenes. An all around fabulous movie.
We also bought Red 2 just as much fun but really missed Morgan Freeman
Good movie and great price. Customer service at store was great.
Great action scenes and comedic performances. If you like Bruce Willis and John Malkovich, you will love this movie. I love the idea of retired, extremely dangerous
I love this classic action movie very much! But one if you like it.
totally enjoyed this movie about aged n retired secret agents, its age target is for those who are seniors and newly retired who as I will certainly enjoy. big time stars, bruce willis, morgan freeman, ernest borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss to name a few.
i enjoyed this movie a great deal at the theatre and had always wanted to own it. fantastic acting and action from bruce willis and morgan freeman, now aged screen stars, lots of tricks and laughs.
Great movie. Both first and second and are good. Nice spin on an action movie.
Great movie for movie night with the wife she enjoyed it
This is such a funny and entertaining action movie! Glad to find it on BluRay!
Bruce Willis, Helen Miren and Richard Dreyfuss with supporting cast is great!
Everything was great, Store service really good. Great movie
Fantastic cast! Sweet fight scenes! Traveling suggestions!! And did I mention cutie Karl Urban is in it?!
Great place to find movies for the family and just to watch
This movie was as good as the previews led me to believe. Very funny and held the interest.
Lots of action! Great acting by Bruce and the gang! Like the slow motion shootout scenes!
loved the action in this movie. There was alot of big named actors in the movie. I loved it.
This movie was a xmas gift ordered last minute. It came very quickly and made a great gift.
Saw this movie on Cable and had to have it. It's a funny and all time fun movie to enjoy.
Love it, love it, Love it. cant wait for RED 2 Great to watch with My Folks.
Great movie, fun, lots of good actors in the cast. Great entertainment.
luv all the actors/actresses in this movie...cant wait to get Red 2
Great action film. Love all the characters
Best movie in a long time. Has something in it for every one.
so nice to go to the mail box and find this wonderful treat
Excellent never a dull moment! The scenes were beautiful!
Money well spent. Waiting on Red II to hit the shelves!
This is an excellent movie, enjoyed it thouroughly.
A lot of action in this movie.Go out and get it.
This movie is very riveting and entertaining.
Great movie, lots of action and humor.
received before due date evcelent
I will be ordering from here again
Loved the film, loved the price
Movie was very good..a must see
Great acting, fantastic chemistry.
good movie-action and comedy
I really enjoyed that movie
Good movie, I liked it.
Very funny movie
movie was great.
great price.
An awesome film! I really enjoyed Agent Cooper, who now stars in the T V drama Almost Human And I adore Helen Mirren. What a departure from her usual roles! All in all, a beastly film!
could not find in any local stores-had to order online. good movie for five bucks. as always Hollywood could have done a better job producing a movie without all the language.
I really like this movie but the online price is 2.50 more than in the store, I only payed 5.00 for this movie at the store. Best movie I've seen In almost 3 years.
This is a very good movie. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of heart warming action without the gore and graffic love scenes. Very little language. A lot of fun.
This movie has a lot of big name older stars, that still have the moves. It is a great twist on the Spy game. Great action sequnces, lots of humor, great acting.
This is a movie my husband and I enjoyed at the theaters. My adult children watched it with us here at home for a movie night and agreed it was a good choice.
This is a fast paced action comedy with an excellent ensemble cast. Bruce willis and crew aim to please and don't fail from start to finish
Great!
I have been able to find and purchase several movies that I have been looking for for a long time thank you very much
I saw that Red 2 was coming out at the movies and never saw the first one. Had to get it before I saw the second one.
I purchased it for my 11 year old grandson and he loves it! I also own it, but have had it for a long time.
I LOVE this movie, and RED 2 as well. You can't beat the prices at Walmart, and the shipping was very fast.
It was a great surprise for me this movie, really funny with great actors. I'm planning to buy Red 2.
Awesome movie with alot of great in the actor/actress industry. Action packed all the way thru
This movie suprised me it was the best movie i have seen in a long time a great cast and plot
great movie! great price!
Bought on sale great price. Fun to watch.
Excellent movie, see second movie.

Red is great popcorn fun that I think you will enjoy. The movie stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, and very funny John Malkovich. The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan. The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous. I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. Thank you for reading my review
This movie was absolutely great. i usually not big into action but my dad is and we both loved it so much that i bought it for us right after we rented it
Good movie and Bruce Willis was a success again!
A FUN MOVIE IT WILL HOLD YOUR INTREST
This is a great movie that will keep you very well entertained. Bruce Willis is great along with his supporting cast.
My husband and I just love this movie.
Action packed. Must see.
funny funny
Good movie, funny, very good actors,
Does not disappoint
Price was great.
inconvenient to go to the back of the store to photo department instead of customer service, won't do it again
I love this movie! It is funny very action packed and the actors/actresses are great! Well put together! A lot of awesomeness in this one movie! I watch it all the time just because it's that good! Love love love!!
This is a great movie! I love this movie and when you buy from Walmart- it is also available on VUDU!
I could drink this with a straw. Nasty, full of water. What happened to your good chili
I was completely disappointed in this item. I opened the can and there was a smell emanating from it that made me sick. Since it was just 2.00, I threw it away. I will NEVER purchase this chili again. I know it may have been a bad can, but that smell was like dead flesh. UGH!
I can not eat anything with Monosodium glutamate in it. I would love to eat your chili but until it is MSG free I can not
I used to buy Hormel chili all the time because it did not have pork in it. Now I will not be buying it. I was very surprised to see this. Why did you have to add pork
Bland and want buy again
This recipe for your chill is horrible. You need to revert back to the recipe you used twenty years ago, then it taste great. I will not be buying your chill until a new and improved recipe comes out. And it better be good.
I had to throw out all my Hormel Chili. Some of us don't eat pork for reasons other than health and this was always in our food stock. Very sad that they changed and DID NOT TELL ANYONE! Now we know.
Purchased this chili for years. It was the best. Would buy by the case and eat once or twice a week. About a year or so ago Something changed. Now I have a lot of cans that I will not eat and really would not even give away, it's that bad. It sits on the shell and finally I have resolved to just toss it out.
Same as Wolf brand that is why we quit Wolf brand and now they are the same. Watery, no meat and yuk!!!! We will never buy again. We will just make our own
I have been buying Hormel chili all my life, the can I opened tonight was the worst. It made the whole hotdog taste bad. It was runny, no meat, so runny it made the bun soggy! I hope Hormel fixes this problem. I'd hate to change brands.
Use to be years ago this is the only kind of chili my grandparents had in our house, but I will not be buying it anymore since I now know that it has pork in it. I do not eat pork, so surely do not want it in my chili
I usually buy the turkey no bean chili so had not had this for years. Well I accidently grab this product and I could not believe how runny and lack of meat was in this chili. It had the consistency of soup which was pretty pitiful since I was having chili dogs. Very sad
Hormel added pork to their no beans chili, since I cannot eat pork I can no longer enjoy my previously favored brand. On top of it there were no warning on the label indicating that they had a major recipe change and I can no longer trust this brand. I would love to be able to eat their product, previously it had been my go-to and always in my pantry.
Used to buy this often. Either the chili has changed or my taste buds have! Would not buy again
Runny
This tastes like canned hot dog sauce more than chili. It might be okay on a hot dog with onions, but not for a bowl of chili. I won't buy it again.
Did not care for the taste and too greasy.
I LIKE HORMEL CHILI, BUT, WALMART HAS PROBLEMS WITH CANNED GOODS. BUY IT AT THE STORE. BIG TIME DENTS.
Good product, way too expensive.
the recipe in the cans has changed over the years. I enjoyed the older versions. They had a better chili favor. The last few years I had to add more chili powder.
Since when does Hormel put pork in their hormel chili :( i cant eat pork, so now I can't enjoy my hormel chili cheese dip :(
The chili is great on a hotdog, but it doesn't taste real good alone.
I like it
Great for chilly dogs
Ok for chili in a can
The chilie was good on the hot dogs and cheese. I really like the one with bean's.
Works in a pinch with hotdogs
Good on chili dogs!
It's ok
Great for Texas hots. The only one I've found that has real meat in it.
Love this stuff but you gotta have BEANS!
We have used Hormel Chili No Beans for a very long time. We use it on our hot dogs.
Good price and product
We love this at our house. We use it as one ingredient to make a quick mexican dip to snack on or for parties. Add over a block of cream cheese and top with your favorite cheese and jalepenos as you like.....bake or microwave and serve!
Hormel chili is a great chili for those looking for a meatier home made chili taste. It's thicker that Texas Pete's and avoids the blandness of Patterson's. This chili is close to Mama's so when you're looking for a chili deserving of a hot dog, look no further than Hormel.
Love hot chili with cheese.
Been using about 25 years. Good for so many dishes.
I love to use this to make chili dogs and chili cheese fries. I tried other fancier brands, but I always go back to this.
Meal in a can, very good, I will buy more
I use this to make a dip. Mix 8 oz cream cheese with chili, heat and serve with tortilla chips.
Item has a reasonable price. If a lot of item is age, note that it causes severe acne.
I haven't used this yet but have had Hormel products before and been happy.
I bought this thinking that no beans meant low carbs but I was wrong - 19g carbs per serving (2 per can). Good flavor, slight chili buzz. The texture is a bit pasty but is great for putting on hot dogs or in tacos.
We use this on hot dogs with shredded cheese! Yummy!
I look for brands I like . but can't always get them as quantities are too large. This isn't as spiced as I like, but Wolfe Brand is all sauce and little meat now.
always liked this chili
This is great if you add it to Velveta or cheese sauce.
I use this chili on my beef enchlidas, so good.
Cant really mess up canned chili cheese tatter tots
Exactly what I was expecting
Love this chili. Great as chili and also as dip mixed with Velveeta cheese or cream cheese. Dip with crackers or corn chips. Great for the holidays.
Easy and always GOOD.
I love this chili on hot dogs...or a chili dog!
Always good on hotdogs but better in dip
Always use this to make haystacks
This is usually a good product!
Plenty of flavor and was a great topping for the hotdogs!
I use this Hormel Chili - No Beans for chili and cheese tater tots. My daughter is not a bean fan so this works great!
used for chili dogs
...
I have tried a majority of your chilli products awesome
I always buy this product because I do not like chili with beans. As I have aged, beans don't like me! But I've never been able to understand why it cost more to remove beans from a can of chili than to add beans!
Good quality and taste
I used it in my dip and it was delicious .... I use the bean kind too both are amazing!!
Tastes good, but it is canned chili, so don't expect gourmet. I use it on hotdogs, as well as dips for chips. But to eat it like a bowl of chili, no way.
Great on hot dogs!
Works great for chili dogs
Always buy this brand
Good item. Use it to make chili dogs!
Great for Frito Chili pie!
Great taste and exactly what I expected in taste and texture
Great for making dips!
Thank you for adding pork now I can enjoy my hot dog sandwich!!!
I brought chili with beans about 3 weeks ago. I enjoy jow it taste
I love using this chili with rice and butter in a casserole. The flavors are amazing, and my kids love it!
Taste and texture are perfect for a chili dog
I add a can of this plus one can of stewed or other flavor tomatoes plus one can of red kidney beans and a pound of cooked, drained ground beef. my family members have always thought I had a secret chili recipe happening. it freezes in servings for the chili dogs at midnite with a topping of cheese. for years it has worked for me!
I always use the Hormel Chili Hot No Beans for my chili dip. A very simple recipe and everyone loves it! Mix 2 cans of the 15oz chili with 1 lb shredded jalapeno jack cheese. I cook it in a slow cooker/crock pot, stirring occasionally until the cheese is melted. Serve with tortilla chips (scoops work best). Hope you enjoy them!
Good tasting a GREAT value!
Apparently the Wal mart store I frequent never has Hormel Turkey Chili wth no beans which I prefer. So I buy Hormel Chili no beans instead. It's been several months since I've seen it on the shelf. And who ever orders replenishment for the store must not like it cause I never see it. Along with frozen vegetables like Coliflower I've asked several times over the last year for those two items and I get a we'll try harder next time. The shelf label is there just not the correct product. Everything I buy at WalMart is good and fresh when available especially the produce like fresh Coliflower which I cut up an freeze before using as needed. I like shopping at WalMart and usually find everything I need when I don't I improvise or substitute.
Lol. Never been asked to review a canned good. It's a can of chili, people! The cylinder shape of the package was phenomenal. Loved the sound of popping the top. It's a consistent, reliable product. My son loves with Fritos. Rofl.
This is the only chili product I consume. I would never buy another brand. It tastes great and doesn't have odd additives I don't like.
I purchased this for my special chili dogs. This item was of good quality and worked out great!
Tastes great
Great for canned chili. Even the kids will eat it because it has no beans.
Good
Hormel No bean chile mixed with Hormel vegetarian chile. Great combination!!! Simple to make don't need a grocery list of ingredients.
Good for chili dogs
The best can chili.
It actually HAS some beans in it though!
Great chili every time.
Great for making chili dogs
Yes, I did buy this item and this is the only one I do buy when I need canned chili to serve with hotdogs. It's a brand I can count on. I would like to buy the one with beans but I have to please everyone in the family, so I just buy the plain, no beans. I would recommend these to everyone.
We really like hot dogs and every once in a while we make some great chilli dogs with Hormel Chili its fast and ready for the boys quick and they love it. add some cheese and onions and wala they are happy campers
An quick alternative to making chili from scratch. Good on a dog, or on it's own and can easily be doctored up to put some heat in it.
I loe Hormel chili! Great taste alone, on a hot dog or baked potato or on chips. I also use this product or Hormel Chili with Beans in my homemade chili for a little extra burst of flavor.
My man grew up with this and he loves it for chili. I use it for a sauce on a hot dog. Either way, it's good to eat.
I wouldn't buy any other but Hormel.I think it has best taste than any of the others.My number 1 pick always.
My husband will only eat Hormel chili without beans. He loves on hotdogs, spaghetti, and by itself. We recently started eating it on super nachos. It's great!
My husband likes this chili without beans
The only chili that comes in our house!
From the can or on a dog.Great anytime it is def winter staple
I love the consistency you get when buying this product! I normally add it to a hot dip recipe but it's equally delicious on its own.
I love Hormel chili and the price is awesome!
I enjoy this Hormel chilli. WITH NO beans. Goes well on hot dogs too!!
very good product good price fast delivery I am wheelchair bound this delivery service is great for me makes shopping easy
This is the best canned chili ever! Quick and easy on the rough nights when I don't have time.
Great product! We used it to make Chilidogs
The only product I use on my hotdogs.
This is the best hot dog chili.
For years we've been making Ugly Dip (cuz it's just not that pretty to look at!) with a can of Hormel Chili NO Beans and one brick of cream cheese. Microwave for about a minute, stir, and continue until all the cheese is blended. Fabulous with corn/tortilla chips and people rave about it - thinking it was much more difficult to make than it really is!! It never lasts long...
I buy this chili regularly and my daughter loves it when when I heat it up in a large bowl, cover it with shredded cheddar cheese and heat it again to melt the cheese. Then she uses Tostitos scoops to scoop and eat it. She is older and out of the house now but when she comes home she always looks forward to her chili bowl!
Love this gor chili dogs on a cold night
good chilli for hotdogs
Best chili ever

This is good by it's self or with rice. Even over chops with cheese
Hormel Chilli is thick and creamey and is very good on hot dogs. I have been using it for years.
I have used this brand of chili for years and I have tried others and always go back to Hormel!
I am not allowed to come home without this when I do my monthly shopping trip!
Tastes great.. very filling... I use often to make frito pie!
I love chili dogs but don't care for the beans Hormel is the perfect choice
We love this on chili dogs and frito pie! High recommend this!
Great chili for those who do not like beans.
This is great on hot dogs
Good chili
was excellant with the hot dogs and cheese we used
This chili is absolutely delicious. We put it on hot dogs, too, for a cili dog with cheese. It's fast and easy to use and filling. This is a good price also.
My daughter luvs it to make chili dog s. She is very picky.
Tasted like chili to me - I got it because of the 'no beans'.
Best hot dog chili I bought! Great flavor, thick, and meaty! It's all I'll buy from now on! Love it!!
Taste good
Best chili
We use it all the time! Goes well with almost anything if you need a quick and easy dip.
Great
Sister-in-law recommended, put in maid rites for better tste
Great taste. I use it on hot dogs, chilli cheese fries.
I like hirmel
I use 1 can of this with a of Velveta and about a cup of milk in the crock pot for some great cheese dip.
Can't get through the holiday without Hormel Chili.....makes great nachos, chili and just to use quick meal
This is the only can chili I will buy.
Great product always use when grilling hot dogs, etc
always tasty
Tastes great!
Product is great for hot dogs, sausage, or just as a meal.
Best chili on the market, would not buy anything else.
The price was good, had a football game get together and has chili dogs :)
Some good stuff
This is the only canned chili my family will eat.
To expensive
Great to be canned chili
Best chili
It is a very good chili
Excellent on hamburgers and hotdogs.
Great item fair price
I've been using this for years.
Love this stuff with nachoz
This chili is good on hot dogs!
My husband loves the chili with out the beans strong spices which can will upset his tummy! A great treat for cool winter days. Lots of tender meat sauce that is just right!
Hormel makes the best chili you can buy,,2nd best to homemade
My favorite store bought chili! Good price.
Great for chili dogs all summer.
My favorite for hotdogs and without the beans has a great chili flavor. Seems to be very lean and not full of fat and grizzle. I pay a little more for quality when it comes to this.
This is the only kind of chili I buy to put on hot dogs. It has a great flavor and texture.
It's the BEST
Very Good!
not too watery and good with hot dogs
We use this chili for making Chili Dogs and it is the best. Beans are not necessary to make good chili as I hae been making both red and green chili, from scratch, for years. This is just a quick alternative to home made chili.
Mis with sour cream great for dipping
Love the taste and texture! So yummy on hot dogs! Good price, too!! Try it, you'll love it!!
It's the only brand my family buys and has done for years.
Always pleased with Hormel.
Great by it self with cheese n onions and use corn chips. Or do the same over a hotdog.
We love this chili over spaghetti with cheese on top.
first time I've tried this and it was very good
We use Hormel chili without beans with shedded cheddar cheese an Fritos as party food and my kids love it!
Taste great
Good
Taste is very good
Great for chilie dogs
I use this item when I make chili dogs. I put hot dogs or Polish sausages in a baking dish, cover with chili, and bake at 400 for about 30 minutes. YUM
I use this for chili cheese dip. Very good
Its a delicious food. I like it. I would recommend it.
I love this chili, it's the only kind out of a can I'll eat! My only suggestion is considering making cans half of the size of this one because I always end up throwing half of it away :(
Very convenient
I have tried other no bean brands of chili and they almost always have beens. This is the only one I have found that actually has NO BEANS, and it tastes great too (which is the important part right)
Its delicious on a hotdog
Hormel Chili with no beans has been my families favorite for years! I remember my mother using it to make me chili dogs and now I use it for my kids and I'm happy to say they love it! I have tried other brands but we can always taste the difference, even the kids will notice the lack of meat and flavor in the other brands. Hormel always wins in my house!
Not anything this is so good i've bought it for years love it.
Only canned chili I will buy. Great flavor and less fat than some other brands.
Some of the best chili we have bought we also love the turkey chili excellent flavor and texture
Would not make hot dogs without it.
This is the best chili around! I wish I could find it in Australia
Hotdogs and chili is a weakness for me, I just don't feel right when I go without for too long. And it's always hormel no beans when I do. I've recently started chopping up the hot dogs and making my own sort-of burrito, it's very tasty, I don't know why I never thought of it before.
Has good flavor for chli dogs and frito pie.
This is a great product. I use it in making Tamale Pie. Love it!
Nothing to say here.
This meal was extremely sweet and had a very strong pepper flavor. I could not eat it.
Chicken was white meat, breaded, about 3 pieces, lots of bell pepper, Sauce was thick on the rice and contents and totally overwhelmed it. Did not care for the taste of the sauce.
This had really bad flavor. Was not a good product.
Chicken quality was poor. Taste was not good, overall not worth the money.
Loaded with salt and carbs.. Grammy
For my personal preference I won't buy this again, the rice was sticking together and only a few morsels of chicken.
It had good taste quality. However, near the bottom the rice was gummy and it wasn't mixed proportionately.
my mother in law specifically asks for these little meals, so she can heat up lunch with no assistance.
I get this whenever want something easy. As frozen goes is good.
I LOVE this and every Tai Pei frozen Asian take-out box meals I've tried. Why are you consistently out of stock on nearly ALL of them As a primary shopper and shareholder of Walmart, I'm not very happy about the lack of stock of this item (and numerous other brands of products) at my store.
I stumbled upon this product a week or so ago, and bought it because I had never heard of it before. It absolutely exceeded all of my expectations it is restaurant quality, has simple and easy preparation, and has ideal portion sizes.
I LOVE TAI PEI DINNERS
Good flavor, easy to prepare, quick, try it for those days you can't face the stove.
The sweat and sour chicken with the rice make an each dinner.
I would recommend these meals to my friends and family. We have not had any bad meals by this company.
My daughter loves this
Fresh tasting, kids love this
Great taste
I discovered this Item about a year ago. Easy to prepare and taste great.
good stuff cant' beat the price
This is an outstanding product, it not only cleans surfaces, but it has such a clean and fresh smell..I use it all the time.
I have been an avid user of Clorox Wipes for many years and loved them. Something has been changed about them recently and my last 3 purchases have all exhibited this change - the SMELL. It is awful. They all smell the same. I don't know if people on the west coast are familiar with stink bugs but here on the east coast, there is an infestation. That's exactly how the Clorox wipes smell now. Please change back to the old formula QUICK!!!!!!
I have used Clorox Wipes for years... Cannot live without them (or prefer not to). Now the smell is so irritating, I will have to purchase another brand to continue my Spring cleaning. I've never had such a strong objection to the smell of any cleaning product. Please at least offer a choice in the old vs. new formula.
I use Clorox wipes fanatically all over my home and I have done so for years - I have always loved them...until now! I just got the wipes with grease fighting power and it smells HORRIBLE. The main reason I use these wipes is because they make stuff smell fresh and clean. I am sad to say, I may be looking for a new product. Maybe Clorox can offer 2 different kinds I don't really have grease in my bathroom, or on my main kitchen counter spaces, usually grease is only on my stove...
Being a mom of three, disinfecting the home has always been a big priority to keep my family healthy and germs at a minimum. I always turn to Clorox to make that happen. I have been using these products for many years and will continue to do so. Thanks for all of the great products that you offer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
LOVE Clorox wipes, but this batch is horrible. The wipes have separated and won't come out of canister in one piece. They rip and tear apart which then makes using 1 wipe useless. You have to get several out just to clean something. The smell is great tho.
I normally buy Clorox brand disinfecting wipes over generic wipes because I like the Fresh Scent. I notice that you've changed the scent and strongly dislike it. While I'll look for Lavender scent in the future, I suspect it does not have wide distribution.
Please go back to original scent/formula!! The other scent was wonderful...New one literally gives me a headache!! So sad.
I would give ZERO stars to the New Formula Clorox Wipes. I agree with all the other users that say the new formula smells awful. It may cut grease now but I liked the old streak free formula a lot better and it smelled nice. Whatever is in the new formula that cuts grease also makes my hands burn. I've switched to my store brand now since they work just as well as the new formula and they smell better. And they don't make my hands burn when I use them! And they don't leave streaks all over my bathroom counters, mirrors and stove like the Clorox wipes do now. Everyone (including me) used to love Clorox wipes when they first came out. Learn a lesson Clorox- if it isn't broke, don't try to fix it!
These are the most frustrating and useless wipes on the market. They rip coming out of the container! If I can't get them out of the container in one piece what good is a bunch of little pieces. Not happy at all! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have used Clorox wipes for a number of years and was excited to try the new products. While I really like the new dispensing top the new scent is unpleasant and I wouldn't call it lemon. I also didn't think that the quality of cleaning was as good as the old product. While the new wipe is textured on one side and soft on the other I felt like I had to scrub much harder and the surface didn't get as clean. I will not buy this product again.
I was expecting these wipes to have a strong clorox smell but they don't, they actually have a refreshing fragrance. I use them regularly and feel confident that I'm eliminating germs from every surface on which I use them.
I LOVE clorox wipes and have used them and recommended them to all my friends since they came out. That being said the change in formula that adjusted the fragrance is horrible. They give me migraines every time they are used in the house and leave a horrible chemical scent instead of the old fresh clean smell. Please go back to the old one because I love your brand and will hate to switch.

i like the wipes cause they are easy to use and handy to keep in all the roooms in the houw This review was collected as part of a promotion.
it would really be nice if the wipe would PICK UP the hair and dust that accumulates in bathroom rather than just moving it around and leaving it in a pile on the surface you're working on. You have lots of smart people working for you, it seems that you would have already figured this out. thanks HO Cody WY
i love them, their cheap and desinfected really well especialy if you have kids so handdy This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Although I like the convenience of a wipe, there are a couple of things I do not like about this product. The scent does not appeal to me. Also, the dispenser is frustrating to use. Sometimes many wipes come out, sometimes it takes several minutes to get one out.

I love using this product because is great to clean. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been experiencing problems with the last two containers I have purchased, where the wipes will not separate but instead get caught and tear. It's a waste of sheets, very time consuming to stop and deal with straightening out the knot/jam in the tear point on the container. When separating by hand it appears the perforations were light or non-existent.
I really like the effecitiveness of the clorox wipes, but they all (no matter what scent you use) leave the WORST lint all over whatever you're using them on. It's even on my hands after I've thrown the used wipe away. I will continue to use them, simply because nobody else makes as effective of a wipe, but I will also to continue to be annoyed every time I use them because I have to go back with a cloth to remove the lint the wipes have left behind.

Clorox wipes are easy to use around the house instead of using paper towels. I have a laminate floor so I use them a lot for dirt and spills but I soon noticed the floor was sticky after. I tried cleaning my windows with them but they leave residue marks. I love the smell of all the wipes. I saw someone else commented on the lint residue they leave after cleaning and I also have this problem. They are good for a quick clean but other than that they are average.
I really like the effecitiveness of the clorox wipes, but they all (no matter what scent you use) leave the WORST lint all over whatever you're using them on.

I love using this product at home and in my classroom. It is easy to grab out of the cabinet and disinfect an area. I am a little uncomfortable letting the kids at school use them because it is a harsh cleaning agent (at least in my mind). But I use them frequently once the kids have gone home. The only thing I find frustrating is they don't seem to pick up dust. They mostly just smear when it comes to dust.
I use Clorox on everything in the house really. Not only does it disinfect but it smells so good. The only problem i had was they are so thin,i have to use more than one, and once opened i have a hard time keeping them wet, . Other than that i use them everywhere due to the convenience, and have i mentioned the smell I really like this product and use Clorox products frequently.

I love the convenience of this product, but I don't like that it leaves surfaces 'streaky'. The product is supposed to give me a sense that the surface is clean after I've used it, but the streaks don't convince me that the surface is actually clean, so I have to use another product to clean the streaks.
The disinfecting wipes were great for quick times when I needed to prevent the spread of germs. They were not a useful cleaning wipe. This product would be great for use around sickness, or for routine maintenance around the home.
With toddlers there are lots of messes. But with twins there is twice the mess. Thank goodness for your wipes or I would be spending my evenings cleaning instead of cuddling with them reading a good book, This review was collected as part of a promotion.

My family uses these everyday and my husband also carries these to work to sanitize the truck that he shares with other coworkers by wiping down the steering wheel, gear shifter etc.
These are great. They do a superb job cleaning (we especially use them in the kitchen and bathroom) and disinfecting, and the scent's pleasant too -- not too overpowering, but just enough so it doesn't smell like traditional cleaner. The individual sheets aren't so big they're hard to work with, but not so small you can't get a decent surface area done, either. My only quibble would be that the containers don't keep the wipes from drying out as well as I'd like. They can occasionally be hard to close, and hard to get the sheets to stay in the part where you pull them out. Not that these dry out quickly, but that a more robust container might preserve these even longer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
In 2009 I bought a brand new car with a brand new baby to put in it. As the baby has grown into a messy boy, the car has grown filthy. I attempted to clean the muck off with car cleaners and just couldn't ever get all the yuck off... and they always smelled bad. My husband suggested Clorox with the added, it couldn't hurt to try it. Hesitant about the results and the abrasiveness on my car, I started to scrub. I'll be honest and tell you I went through a whole container, but the car has never looked better! And I didn't mind going through a whole container because Clorox was so much more affordable than the stinky car cleaners. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I really like using wipes to clean counter tops or other surfaces instead of using a cleaner and a paper towel or rag because of the convienience. I really like the smell and feel the area is clean but for really getting a stain or scrubbing, i have found other products that have scubby side of the wipes, also i havnet found that stains from blue berries or things that you need to use other cleaners for that these work on. overall they are great because they disinfecr, smell good and clean!

I love the convenience of these wipes. They are sturdy yet soft and stay moist when sealed properly, and they are able to clean and disinfect in tight spaces. Whenever my family gets sick I go around the house wiping surfaces that are often touched, including remotes and door/faucet handles. I used to do this with lysol spray but found it much more convenient to just target the areas I need without accidentally spraying all over the place (including on my pets!). The Fresh aroma is pretty average and I plan on trying the other scents in the future.
I love this product and use it daily. The price is reasonable and it always leaves my kitchen smelling fresh, not only that, but I know it is disinfecting my counters from certain bacteria. I would recommend this product to almost anyone. When I say almost anyone it is because on the label it says that you have to wipe down the surface with water if you plan to put food on it later, which I worry about with my 13 month old daughter. So read the label. But other than that I love it :)
The Clorox disinfecting wipes (lemon scent) are a great product. I use them all the time in my kitchen because they disinfect and they also get out a lot of stuck on food. I also use them in various places around the house as they are so easy to use. Just grab one and go! You can also buy the smaller packs and use them to disinfect public areas where you might catch the flu. A few examples are shopping cart handles, tables at restaurants, and even door handles in public restrooms. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
These wipes are great for quick and easy clean up of messes. I use them to clean just about every surface of my house. The smell is pleasant and they don't leave behind a harsh bleachy smell. However, on thing I would suggest is making them in a bigger size for bigger messes and to clean more surface.
Hands down the best product to keep my car, my home, and my office germ free! The easy to use wipes go with me wherever life takes me. From my car to a plane to a hotel room, the ready to go Clorox wipes keep me away from germs in shared travel places. In the plane, I disinfect my tray table and remote buttons. In the hotel, the remote control, door knobs, and light switches. Clorox wipes keeps you from bringing home an unwanted souvenir... the flu! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
As a mother of 5, I use disinfectant wipes often. These are handy to wipe down the stair railings, remotes, phones and keep some in the car to wipe off the steering wheel and door. As with just about every pop up wipe container though, I wish there was a better way to make them come out easier at the beginning and the end. Its always a struggle to get them started and at the end they all come out out at once and they are dripping wet. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

start working when mixed with water, which allows you to enjoy whiter laundry and cleaner surfaces without the spills. Do not mix with bleach or other household products. Always read and follow precautions and usage directions before using cleaning products Read more at https://www.clorox.com/products/clorox-control-bleach-packs/vA5fOomhIIIbyABV.99

I love how durable these wipe are. I use them mostly in the kitchen and I can get the grime out from under my stove burner bowls that drives me crazy! If I had to complain, the container can be a pain to get the wipes out!
Clorox wipes are great to have in the kitchen and bathroom. It makes it simple to wipe up counters and stovetops after each cook in between deep cleans. They are durable and easy to use and leave the area smelling clean.
I love these things!!! We have a 1 and 2 year old, and then added a puppy to the mix. Wouldn't you know it, while the puppy didn't have worms, it did have a virus that could be passed to little kids. Ugh... I had 14 days of keeping a puppy and her messes totally away from the kids, and it was no easy task! These wipes were great for keeping the messes contained and dis-infecting the kitchen floor as needed.
I have tried other brands and also lesser priced brands of cleaning wipes and I come back to Clorox. They clean well, stay moist until the end of the roll and my house smells as fresh and I know it is clean. I use the wipes on many things. Often use them just to wipe down my purse when I think of all the yucky places it has landed. Shoes and sneakers also. They have many uses. A Good Product
I love using Clorox products because it is a great disinfectant. The products have a variety of uses from Laundry, bathroom and kitchen cleaning.

I love Clorox disinfecting wipes. They are so convenient to use and they give me piece of mind knowing that whatever gets wiped with them really is, well, clean! I use them on my counters after cutting meat poultry, in my bathroom on my toilet and sink, and they are great for things you touch everyday but never bother to clean, like the trash can lid, door handles, and light switches. I always have a canister within easy reach in my kitchen and bathroom. Oh, and I never travel without my Clorox wipes! I always take some wipes from the canister, stick them in a Ziploc bag, and put them in my purse. Ever been disgusted my a public restroom or porta-potty Not anymore! One time, while at a Kings of Leon concert, my friends and I were waiting in the long line for the ladies room when I suggested to just use the porta-pottys in the smoking area. They were all like, Eww! Gross! No way am I going in one of those! So, I grabbed my Ziploc full of wipes, hopped right into a porta-potty no line, score!, wiped down the door handle first then the seat, gave it a minute to dry and BAM, I'm good to go. Not only did I get back before my friends had even gotten a stall, but I got to use a CLEAN toilet where as they had to do the squat and shuffle! Needless to say, they opted to use the porta-potty the next time around and they stopped making fun of me for being a clean freak....who's laughing now!!! The only reason I didn't give these wipes 5 stars is because they leave streaks and don't work awesomely word or not, I used it! lol on greasy messes...I still have to take out my degreaser when I clean my kitchen.

I love the Clorox wipes! I love to keep them handy for a quick clean up. These were perfcect when we went camping to clean up the camper and tables.

I teach in a first grade classroom - which means it gets a little smelly and a lot sticky all the time. Clorox wipes are great for a end of the week wipe down of the desks/tables, and even better for a spur of the moment wipe down of the work area of a suddenly sick child! Great for everyday cleaning 3 bars because they are a little expensive. But 5 bars on convenience!

So easy to keep around the house, especially with little kids. great for cleaning after dinner as well as in bathrooms. Wish they were less toxic (supposed to wash with water before eating off surface I think) as I care more about just getting something clean than actually disinfecting. These do not bother my skin, however, as some disinfecting products do.

The Clorox wipes are much better to use than generic or even other name brand cleaning wipes. They smell great and I know that it keeps our bathrooms clean since they also include bleach. I would only recommend that they are easier to begin when you open them with the first wipe and that there was not so much liquid left over near the end.
I love the smell but don't like the streaks that it leaves. I feel everything is clean but those streaks drive me crazy.
These wipes are so convenient to use all around the home and office. It is quick way to disinfect surfaces and door handles where most bacteria and viruses are found.

For a quick clean up it works great the only thing that it could improve is to have a little bigger sheets
I appreciate the ease of using the Clorox wipes. I keep a canister in the bathroom, especially when there is illness in the house.

The only downfall, the top of the container never stays together and I end up having to stick my hand in the container and pull the wipes out. However, Clorox wipes offer a thorough cleaning and they are very convenient.
When you need to clean a spill quickly these are the best! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
TOILET LEANER ROCKS makes the toilet very clean and white This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I like Clorox disinfecting wipes better than any others that I have tried because they do not leave as much of a sticky feeling after they dry as other products. Still, there is a sticky residue left behind as well as streaks. I hope that there will be improvements made to the product in the future.

Great for cleaning up small messes and disinfecting! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This works great for cleaning up after preparing meals with meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, etc. The only drawback is that it starts out putting a lot of liquid down, then dries out rather quickly, so you have to use it fast. I like the fresh scent it isn't as overpowering as the scented versions.
Like the product. Will continue to use. Easy to use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
This product always makes my house smell like lemons.
the product is great, fast, usefull. Nice packaging
I love these wipes for cleaning once I get the first wipe pulled out from the middle. I find it very hard to find the middle sometimes. I wish Clorox would put some kind of pull or tab to help the comsumer pull the first wipe out. Otherwise, they are great for cleaning and so convenient.
I often reach for the disinfecting wipes as they are so easy to use. I actually keep them throughout the house (and even at my desk at work). These wipes can handle the daily smaller jobs as well as bigger jobs! I like knowing that these wipes disinfect as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love this cleaning product because it cleans everything in the house.. I don't have to worry about using a spray or anything I just grab and wipe up a mess without worry about staining a rag or dishtowel. Plus they are great deodorizers too... I love them This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I have personally used Clorox Wipes for years. I like the convenience and ease of using Clorox Wipes. I can trust that my surfaces are truly clean and disinfected. But what I love most is that my husband will help me clean when I have Clorox wipes on hand. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
My favorite feature of this item is the scrubbing side it works great in the kitchen. The only down side is that its difficult to get the wipes out once you get to the end, I spilled the solution all over the floor trying to get the last one out lol This review was collected as part of a promotion.
A new use for your wipes Attach them to your floor cleaning pad and use to disinfect the floor. They are much cheaper than the cleaning pads made for the this device. The only thing I don't like is that they aren't the easiest to get out of the canister. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I have been using this product forever it seems. This is one product that I can say I am brand loyal to. I love the smell and the feeling of clean that comes with wiping things down with them. It is so nice to grab a wipe rather than a spray jug and a towel.
I love how these wipes make my kitchen smell like lemons, although I use them in virtually every room in the house. Especially handy for the bathroom and for sanitizing and de-odorizing the cat box. Also keep them in the car for sticky fingers and spills This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love the smell that you can clean and disinfect at the same time. I like that you can use them on most anything. Th eone thing I really dont like about them is for some reason they are much wetter then the Lysol cleaning wipes. all in all they are good.
My husband and I just got a little puppy so there are always small messes around the house. I am a little bit of a clean freak so knowing that I am cleaning up his messes with a product that will disinfect while I wipe makes me feel so much better!
While I love the scent of the Fresh Scent, these lemon scented Clorox wipes do the trick! They are very easy to use and I love having them available to wipe down heavily used counter tops, the fridge door as well as the kitchen table every morning! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Clorox wipes are easy to use and a great way to spend your money. They disinfect and you can use them for easy spills. They are a nice product to use if you need to clean something quickly, and also thou roughly. I highly recommend this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
Having these Clorox wipes on hand means I clean more often. I'm not sure what it is about them since I could just as easily spray a paper towel and clean. But I love having these on hand to do a quick cleaning of the bathroom counter and toilet. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I love Clorox wipes, after my family eats a meal or after I clean the kitchen, Clorox wipes are a great way to pick up the mess. Even the stove, especially with the grease! I couldn't imagine having a household without Clorox wipes in my house! This review was collected as part of a promotion.
These are the only disinfecting wipes i use.... depending on the size of the mess, i can usually wipe down my whole countertop with just one wipe... leaves my surfaces shiny, clean smelling great, and most importantly, i know thye are germ free!
I like how easily the Clorox wipes clean spots and stuff off the counters and surfaces. The smell of them is usually okay but sometimes a little chemically. I do wish they wouldn't make the skin on my hands feel as weird as they do. Thanks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I absolutely loves these handy wipes. They are so useful all around the house are great at removing stains from my counter tops and disinfecting everything in the bathroom. The only downfall is they just spread dust around but nothing is perfect!
I really like the wipes because I can use just the right amount and not have such a strong bleach smell throughout my house and my oldest can use them and I don't have to worry about her ruining something by spilling the bleach everywhere. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The wipes make it really easy to wipe my entertainment center. (Which gets dirty and dusty very quickly.) If I am really just wanting to get my kitchen counters clean, I hurry and grab a wipe. They sanitize quickly and I really like that. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
They are so easy and convenient to use for clean ups and disinfectants. I don't have to leave a yucky sponge on the sink! I wish that there was a little more in the canister for the cost, but so far it hasn't stopped me from buying them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
I am in love with this product. The time it saves makes the little extra expensive worth it. It saves me time in preparing cleaning supplies for a job as well as the time it takes to wash the products I would normally use to clean with. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
The Clorox disinfecting wipes are a good product, that has may uses. There are a few improvements that could be made however. The towels themselves should be stronger. They seem to disintegrate before all of the cleaning fluid has been used.
These wipes are very handy for getting your cleaning done quickly. I keep them in the bathroom and use them to wipe down all surface areas for a quick 10 minute cleaning. Keep it up every week and it's that easy to maintain a clean room. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
These can be used for almost type of cleaning. It even makes cleaning easy and sometimes fun for all 3 of my kids. From wiping doorknobs, remote controls and light switches to cleaning a dirty pair of shoes, these wipes can do most any job!
I really like the smell and clean look I get on my tub, sink and toilet after using the disinfecting wipes. The fresh smell is wonderful rather than a chemically smell. I wish the wipes were larger since I find myself doubling up on them.
The cloths are sturdy and have a mild, pleasant scent - nothing overpowering. Great for wiping down things that shouldn't get too wet. The only negative feature of this product is that it is sometimes difficult to dispense the first wipe.
This is a great product for killing germs. It has a great scent not too over powering. I really like this product and I use it alot. The price is usually good. The wipes are great for everyday messes around the house. I like this product.

I quite enjoy this product. The scent is wonderful and fresh. And then the wipes are very durable and I use them in my kitchen to clean my stove and etc. I also use them to clean my floor boards and different areas in my bathroom.

I love keeping Clorox disinfecting wipes under all the sinks in my home for quick clean ups. We buy meat in bulk and package it in freezer bags..these are great for wiping down the counter after dealing with all the raw meat :-)
Love these wipes! They are perfect for when you are in a hurry. Or just have a small area to clean. Not a big fan of germ infested sponges so these make a nice alternative. They also have a nice scent that is not overwhelming.
I love everything about these wipes but the scent can be very over powering. It eventually airs out without help, it's not a big issue unless you don't like lemon. I prefer the fresh scent. Works wonders on my stove! This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I love the way this leaves a good smell after i clean. This is the only one that I use. Thanks Clorox
I love these. They make clean up easy and I can throw away the mess and the germs.
Clorox is a name that epitomizes clean. When I use your products in my home I know that germs are being reduced and my family is safer from the things that may make them sick. My whole family uses the Clorox line of products but I especially like the ease of use that the wipes offer. The wipes are portable so you can move them from room to room or take them on the road and they always offer the same confidence of clean no matter where we might be.
I use these to wipe the seat when I use the public rest room. I keep several in a ziploc bag in my purse.
I have four sons and I run a daycare. Enough said on how often the bathroom needs disinfected around here. I love that I can have my 9 year old clean the bathroom with the wipes and not worry about him using too much or too little clener. He misses spots but the main surfaces are nice and clean, atleast for a moment:)
This is the only disinfecting wipe that I use. I LOVE IT!!!
I like the clean smell and the wipes dont fall apart easily.
I love to clean my kitchen and bathroom counters with them. The scent is refreshing and not overpowering. I also put them on my mop instead of mopping cloths sometimes. A very good product.
I use this product after my grandchildren come in from school after their mother picks them up to wipe down the kitchen counters and toys. It has cut down on illnesses we kept getting from them being exposed at school.
I love these wipes, I am a clean, disinfecting freak... I use clorox bleach on everything to clean. These are so convenient and not as harsh as using regular bleach for everyday cleaning. I have tried other disinfecting wipes and don't like them as well. These are sturdier and have a fresher scent. I will definitely continue to use these and I always am telling my friends they need to us them too.
As a Special education teacher and a mom-these are my best weapon againt germs. I use them almost daily!
I love Clorox disinfecting Wipes as I have two dogs and a messy grandchild and want to aleviate germs as much as possible. I feel I can always trust Clorox products - nice smell doesn't hurt.

A must have during the cold and flu season when you have school aged grandchildren. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
For years, I've kept Clorox wipes in my kitchen and bathroom at home, but I recently started keeping a canister in my desk at work. They're great for quickly disinfecting the phone, keyboard, door knobs....even pens. Once I realized how infrequently the cleaning staff cleans our desks, and how often I eat lunch at my desk, I realized I needed to take matters into my own hands. I now give everything a quick wipe down at least once a day.....even more often during cold and flu season. I really like the lemon scented wipes for this task- they smell clean without smelling too much like a cleaning product. I highly recommend grabbing a few canisters to keep at work, in the car, and of course in the kitchen and bath as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

I always trust clorox wipes and here is why. When my son was a baby he got a very bad stomach virus to the point of almost being hospitalized for dehydration. I began to wipe is crib and everything that came in contact with down every couple of hours for the next 24 hr. What ever the stomach bug was passed and my other 2 babies nor my husband and I never caught it. The dr said it was a terrible bug that entire families were catching but with the help of clorox and some infection control no one else caught it. I always trust clorox because you don't want to see you babies suffer with anything that can be prevented. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
